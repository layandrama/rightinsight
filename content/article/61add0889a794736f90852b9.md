Many parents experience some bewilderment when they first meet Roblox (a virtual platform in which you can create games, navigate different "worlds", communicate and come up with joint activities with other users). Children control their little avatars with great speed, while discussing various “nonsense” in chats. Crowds of avatars run away from dinosaurs, escape from erupting volcanoes, hunt sharks and it seems that they live in a world of endless adventures. Players earn points in the process, and when they're injured or "stuck" and need to "reboot" (in Roblox jargon), the signature "Wow!" sound plays.

And no matter how lost in what is happening parents. Their kids, who probably spend hours in vain trying to explain to moms and dads what's happening on the iPad, are simply obsessed with Roblox. Last year, when the pandemic severely limited meetings, many young people connected to the platform to communicate through it. When outdoor playgrounds were closed, moms and dads exchanged nicknames for children in Roblox and agreed on joint games. Between Zoom calls, parents were asked for “more Robux,” a digital currency that players use to purchase different things for their avatars. Today, 800 Robux costs $9.99, and 100 Robux can buy you a fashionable raincoat.

As of the end of September, the company had more than 47 million daily active users, up from 18 million at the end of 2019 (in the third quarter of 2021, sales after deferred revenue exceeded $637 million, up 28% year-on-year) ). “It took us a while to suddenly realize: incredible, just look at what is happening with the numbers!” Roblox creator David Bazooki says.

He expects the Roblox audience to continue to expand. So far, the platform is very popular among children (about half of Roblox users are 13 years old or younger), but teenagers and young people are increasingly interested in it. According to Bazooka, Roblox plays an important role in the "metaverse" (a Silicon Valley buzzword for holistic digital spaces). In the Metaverse, people also participate in more mundane activities than shark hunting. They attend town halls and industry conferences, gatherings where Roblox has something to offer that Zoom doesn't have. Basically, this is the third dimension in which participants can communicate and explore something together (for example, Roblox has separate game worlds where the user can come and spend time in a certain way).

Like many other Silicon Valley billionaires, Bazooka is modest and not well known. In conversation, he comes across as a pragmatic and slightly mischievous school teacher - a person who can explain to the interlocutor the meaning of Newtonian mechanics and immediately after that show how to assemble a T-shirt cannon. He grew up in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, where he rode off-road motorcycles and built racing karts. He read a lot of science fiction, loved Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game, Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, and anything to do with exploring the unknown. The future creator of Roblox studied engineering and computer science at Stanford. He spent one summer on an internship at General Motors in Flint, Michigan, becoming interested in the lab where engineers experimented with engine computer control:

In the late 1980s, Bazooki co-authored an educational program called "Interactive Physics" that allowed students to conduct experiments in a two-dimensional environment. He later co-founded a company called Knowledge Revolution, which licensed products for schools. The company has also created a 3D mechanical engineering simulator licensed for businesses that make cars, cameras, farm equipment, and copiers. In 1998, Knowledge Revolution was acquired by MSC Software for about $20 million. Bazooka stayed on, but took a break after a couple of years. Oth spent several months traveling in a motorhome with his wife, science fiction writer Ian Ellison, and children.

In the early 2000s, Bazooki and Eric Cassel, who had previously worked as an engineer at Knowledge Revolution, began work on a new simulator. This time, they wanted to build a 3D world where users could create, share, and play games. In 2004, Bazooki and Kassel released DynaBlocks, an online puzzle creation system. According to Bazooka, users found the novelty funny, "but there was no virality."

The following year, they changed their name to Roblox (a combination of the English words "robot" and "blocks") and introduced an online game that caught the attention of a mostly young audience. Then came the free Roblox Studio developer toolkit, and the number of games skyrocketed. The company has begun using real-time data to show kids which games are the most popular. “Some are hard to get away from,” says Bazooki. “For example, from paintball and hide and seek.”

In 2010, the company expanded and moved from Menlo Park, California to San Mateo. Once a week, employees gathered in the evening for a game of poker or board games. They were motivated to spend more than an hour a week playing Roblox and making games. When it came time to make big decisions about which new features to develop, executives were handed out dollar bills to vote on to prioritize votes. According to Matt Finick, then CFO of Roblox, he was surprised when everyone got the same amount to vote on as Bazookas. "I'm in finance," Phoenix says. — But this is Dave — he wanted to understand who I am. He liked it when people really got into it."

Over time, the platform developed its own economy. Using Robux, players can purchase various items within the game, such as more powerful weapons; In addition, a premium membership club has opened in Roblox. Today, for $4.99 a month, players get 450 Robux, the ability to trade purchases with other players, and additional perks. A developer exchange that allows game creators to convert Robux into real dollars is set to pay out more than $500 million this year.

One of the most high-profile examples of Roblox turning into a metaverse occurred in November 2020, when American country rapper Lil Nas X hosted virtual live performances on the platform that lasted two days. Bazooki, who everyone calls the "builder" of the platform, was present virtually along with his daughter. During the hit "Old Town Road", performed in a Western-style "set", Lil Nas X's fashion avatar swelled to gigantic proportions. A crowd of roblox avatars danced at his feet. The show has amassed over 30 million views, according to the company. “It was something completely new,” Bazooki says.

[According to Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/) analysts[](http://www.bloomberg.com/)Intelligence, the metaverse could become an $800 billion market by 2024. Researchers and industry observers believe that Roblox has a great chance to capitalize on this, as the company has already created compelling 3D worlds. Kids who play on the platform will probably continue to use it through college and beyond. “We're at that exciting early stage where each company has its own internal vision of the metaverse,” Bazooki says. For now, in addition to organizing concerts, Roblox is teaming up with brands so that users can shop on the platform with Robux. In May, the company unveiled a virtual space created in collaboration with Gucci in Roblox, with exclusive virtual clothing and accessories.

Of course, as the platform diversifies and users mature, it will become increasingly difficult to keep kids safe. Over the years, neo-Nazis and pornography distributors have infiltrated Roblox. The company moderates the chats to block inappropriate content. In September, the age verification feature was introduced so that children can scan documents and take selfies, confirming their age from 13 years old and older. In the future, some users who go through the whole process will be able to try the Spatial Voice add-on, which allows players to directly talk to each other through microphones, and not just chat. Avatars will sound differently depending on how far apart they are in 3D space.

According to Bazooka, eventually the physics of the Milky Way will merge with the physics of Roblox. If, for example, you drop a mug in the Roblox virtual kitchen, the sound and splash will be the same as if you broke it at home. “If we can do this,” Bazooki says, “we will have things that people have only dreamed of.” He means that the metaverse will become a common place to spend time. Yes, there will be volcanoes erupting and medieval battles unfolding, but at the same time there will be corporate meetings and even remote lessons. “We can dissect a frog together,” says Bazooki.
