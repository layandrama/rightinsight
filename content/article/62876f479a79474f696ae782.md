1\. [Get It Done: Surprising Lessons from the Science of Motivation, by Ayelet Fishbach](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Done-Surprising-Lessons-Motivation/dp/0316538345)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You decided to do a run in the park in the morning, but quickly gave up. Perhaps the problem is that you set the goal incorrectly, says behavioral psychologist Ayelet Fischbach. She has studied goal setting for over 20 years and wrote this book to help people overcome procrastination and achieve their goals.

One of the key principles that Fischbach talks about is this: the achievement of a goal is influenced by its formulation. The phrase “You have to run in the morning” sounds boring and does not cause emotional excitement. To motivate yourself, you need to communicate a charge of interest to your goal: “I run to look attractive.” Or, if the mode of action does not suit you, you should change it to a more fun one: for example, take up Nordic walking or play frisbee instead of running.

Also, Ayelet Fischbach debunks the common misconception that fantasy is a strong influence on motivation. Imagining that you are in great shape, you will not train better. Visualizing an ideal relationship will not increase the chances of meeting a partner. “Making a plan is definitely going to help,” Fischbach says. Another way to motivate that works is to create an environment where you are more productive. For example, running in the park not alone, but with someone or organizing a frisbee club.

The author devotes a separate chapter to the fight against temptations. She advises reducing the impact of distractions with a so-called broad decision frame. If you decide that this month you will have soup and salad for lunch, it will become easier for you to adhere to the principles of healthy eating than if you thought through lunch every day. At the same time, you still have freedom of action: there are hundreds of recipes for soups and salads on the Internet.

2\. [The Power of Regret: How Looking Backward Moves Us Forward, by Daniel Pink](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Regret-Looking-Backward-Forward/dp/0735210659)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regret is painful, it is customary to brush it aside or get rid of it. And to live, regretting nothing, is just a dream. But both strategies are wrong, says publicist Daniel Pink. “There is no life without regrets,” he says. And those who outwardly do not lament about anything are just good actors.

{{< img src="ANTd3qD.jpg" width="600" height="900" >}}

Pink believes that regret works as a tool for reflection and self-learning. Not regretting the past means not learning anything. “For example, you opened a business, it failed, and you are sorry. This negative experience will help you respond more calmly to future setbacks, says Pink. \- Most of us understand that we are not in this world forever, so it is better to do something than to do nothing. Regret from imperfect deeds corrodes the soul more than regret from a mistake.

Daniel Pink confirms his reasoning with data from a survey that he launched in 2020. He received over 19,000 responses from people around the world about situations where they were sad about something lost or irretrievable. These studies helped him identify four types of regret. "Fundamental" is best illustrated with an empty savings account at the time of retirement. The second type is "bold" from the series "What if?" remind of the rejection of something risky, of an unlived bright life. The third group are regrets about broken personal ties with family or friends. Finally, there are "pangs of conscience" when people regret that they did not intercede, did not help, silently agreed with evil.

Depending on the type of authority a person is under, his attitude to the world is formed. When you articulate your preferred mode of regret, you are taking the first step on the path to healing. The next step is to rethink it as "the imperfection of human nature." Drawing on research in social psychology and neuroscience, the author shows how to use regret to educate yourself - and eventually become better and make smarter decisions.

3\. [Bittersweet: How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole, by Susan Cain](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/304944/bittersweet/9780241980491.html)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sadness is a resourceful feeling, if properly understood. Former lawyer Susan Cain, author of Bittersweet (Bitter Joy), writes that sadness has two important, albeit paradoxical, features. First, it helps people survive. Drawing on research from psychologists and neuroscientists, Kane explains that it is the vagus nerve that “makes us sad.” This ancient part of the nervous system is responsible, for example, for the desire to protect babies by responding to their crying. It also makes a person able to sympathize and empathize, to share someone else's grief. In fact, sadness is a social emotion that makes us human.

Secondly, sadness is a thirst for an ideal that inspires creativity. Think, for example, of Odysseus' longing for his native home, or the longing of the Sufis for the "beloved of the soul." “Man is arranged in such a way that he wants to live in a more perfect world than ours. When we see a waterfall so beautiful that tears come to our eyes, we get a spiritual impulse. Visible beauty is only a reflection of a more beautiful world, where we came from and where we want to return,” Susan Cain is convinced. It is only thanks to the imperfection of the world that a person is able to experience the full depth of happiness and love.

Having described the physiology and psychology of sadness, the author puts a lot of effort into destroying the formula “sadness equals depression”. According to Kane, in a society of the tyranny of optimism, forced smiles only hurt, but healthy melancholy makes life richer and more meaningful. Perhaps you will look at your sadness from a new angle and learn how to use it as a clue about where to direct your efforts to become happier.

4\. [How Feelings Shape Our Thinking, by Leonard Mlodinow](https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-How-Feelings-Shape-Thinking-ebook/dp/B091PJ8BSJ#:~:text=Mlodinow%20successfully%20shows%20how%20emotions,for%20fans%20of%20Daniel%20Kahneman.%E2%80%9D&text=%E2%80%9CEmotional%20is%20a%20captivating%20exploration%20of%20the%20science%20of%20emotions)

An American fighter pilot, acting strictly according to the charter, shot down a passenger plane KAL 007 over Sakhalin. The Soviet military was so frightened of an imminent nuclear war that he decided not to report to the leadership about the attack registered by the locators, because it looked implausible, and as a result, the alarm turned out to be false. The first was guided by reason and was mistaken, the second relied on feelings and turned out to be right.

{{< img src="HMGh9vw.jpg" width="600" height="900" >}}

These are examples from the book of physicist and mathematician Leonard Mlodinov, a friend of Stephen Hawking and the author of his biography. In a critical situation, an emotional decision is no worse than a rational one, Mlodinov believes. In making important decisions, when many lives are at stake, you should not block feelings, because they control thought. Coolness allows you to assess the prospects of the situation, but in order to make you act, you need really hot emotions.

Feelings are a product of the unconscious, which makes many complex calculations and processes more information than the rational. Therefore, emotions should be used to make informed decisions, even in calm situations. “It happened that I made lists of pros and cons. The points from the “against” column outweighed, but I ignored it, did what I wanted, and turned out to be right,” recalls Mlodinov.

5\. [The Power of Fun: How to Feel Alive Again by Catherine Price](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Fun-Feel-Alive-Again/dp/0593241401)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having fun when there are so many problems around is impossible and just low. Screen time expert and science journalist Katherine Price is ready to argue with that claim. Real fun is not a synonym for the pleasure of a SPA or delicious food, but a tool that will help you survive difficulties. It will also give you a feeling of vivacity and spiritual uplift.

{{< img src="w88K0NG.jpg" width="600" height="900" >}}

Katherine Price conducted a study of 1,500 people and identified three components of true fun: playfulness, connection, and flow. If you are having fun for the sake of the process itself, without expecting a reward or result, that is playfulness. Communication here means interaction with other people in a group or family. And flow is a term from the field of psychology that describes the state of focus and absorption in the process, when you lose track of time.

To begin with, the author suggests scanning your entertainment. Ask yourself: are you completely absorbed in the work, do you feel connections with other people through it, do you have fun for the sake of fun itself. If not, then most likely you are using "fake entertainment". Price includes, for example, hanging in social networks, serials, and harmful fast food. Between the two poles there is also a neutral territory. On it, watching your favorite TV show can really please. But it is important not to let it take over your time and turn into a simulation of pleasure.

Katherine Price also describes how to choose what will be true fun for you: guitar lessons, flamenco or home theater. To do this, she developed the SPARK framework:

*   S (making space) - means to create conditions for proper entertainment;
*   P (pursuing passions) - follow your passion;
*   A (attracting fun) - to attract fun;
*   R (rebelling) - rebel;
*   K (keeping) - continue in the same spirit.

True fun is spontaneous, it cannot be fabricated. At the same time, at first, you may have to make an intellectual effort - remember what makes you happier, or get creative by inventing a “talking plate” with non-trivial questions a la “Which sweater did you like the most as a teenager?”. Price promises that by mastering the practical techniques of real fun, you will become more productive, less stressed, and less likely to be offended.
