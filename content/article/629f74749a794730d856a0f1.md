“Having invested $1,000 in Beyond Meat during the IPO, you could sell the same shares of the company today for $4,500, which means you can increase your investment by 345%,” CNBC journalists [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/06/how-much-an-investment-in-beyond-meat-at-ipo-would-be-worth-now.html) in early February 2020. According to their calculations, investing in one of the most famous manufacturers of artificial meat would allow investors to outperform the S&P 500 index in terms of returns - it added only 14% in the same time.

Beyond Meat shares have proved popular with private and institutional investors since their listing. It took the company just two months to reach the highest mark for itself: on July 26, 2019, Beyond Meat papers [traded](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/history?period1=1556755200&period2=1654560000&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true) at $234.9 apiece.

However, the rise was short-lived, and almost immediately the stock lost about half of its record high. Things continued to deteriorate in 2020, and CNBC made their calculations based on the cost of $111 per share of Beyond Meat.

The beginning of 2022, the crisis in Eastern Europe and the global food crisis predicted by economists, analysts and journalists worsened the situation even more: in just a year, Beyond Meat papers lost almost 90% of their value and fell 60% below the placement price in 2019.

The company's problems are not unique and common to others in the industry. Why did the seemingly favorable situation on the food market and the growing demand after the pandemic turn out to be disastrous for producers of artificial meat?

Weak quarters
-------------

2020 has indeed been one of Beyond Meat's most successful years: plans to open production in [Europe](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2020/06/11/Beyond-Meat-expects-to-begin-European-production-at-end-of-2020-after-Dutch-expansion) and [China](https://www.ft.com/content/1800c0ab-47fa-4f13-a510-1bd3d934ac76) by the end of the year, another [record](https://www.newhope.com/news/beyond-meat-sees-effects-covid-19-q3-earnings) in retail sales and capture even more market share.

The beginning of the second year of the pandemic was also promising for the company: partnership agreements with [McDonald](https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/24595-beyond-meat-announces-qsr-partnerships) 's, [PepsiCo](https://www.ft.com/content/4ec549bc-afb7-4047-a49f-533c53837e7b) and [Yum! Brands](https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/24595-beyond-meat-announces-qsr-partnerships) , a full-fledged launch of production in China, the hope for an early lifting of covid restrictions and the return of consumers to restaurants. However, the company's success did not impress analysts and investors: in the second quarter of 2021, Beyond Meat [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/beyond-meat-quarterly-revenue-misses-estimates-2021-05-06/) higher-than-expected losses, decreased significantly due to closed restaurants and wholesale sales. Experts note that 2021 has become a year of correction for Beyond Meat: if at the very beginning of the pandemic, consumers stocked up on products for future use, then over time, the rush demand faded away and, along with it, the company's performance decreased.

The correction, as well as disappointing financial reports, continued in 2022. Announcing the results of the first quarter of 2022 in mid-May, Beyond Meat [noted](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3837140-beyond-meat-non-gaap-eps-of--158-misses-by-060-revenue-of-10945m-misses-by-215m) that sales fell by 1.2%, and net losses amounted to more than $100 million. The volume of meat sold for the quarter increased. At the end of 2021, sales grew by 11%, and the company's net loss was only $27 million. Beyond Meat shares also do not look good: after entering the stock exchange in 2019, their value exceeded $200, now it is only $25.

“Keeping in mind that Beyond Meat is not going to break even in the foreseeable future, I would stay away from the company's papers,” [Seeking](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4510282-three-reasons-avoid-beyond-meat) Alpha notes. Independent analyst Yiannis Zurmpanos offers a different look at the company's papers: “Beyond Meat's fallen stock really creates an attractive entry point for risk-loving investors. Despite the difficulties, the company can take a bet on the untapped Asian market and return to indicators that satisfy investors and analysts.” At the same time, partnership agreements with the largest players in the catering market remain in force, Zurmpanos points out.

However, for now, Beyond Meat's partners are only worsening the already disastrous position of the company on the stock exchange. On May 24, the artificial meat maker [announced](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/24/kim-kardashian-lends-her-taste-buds-to-beyond-meat-as-first-chief-taste-consultant/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANpFuL6CKdmOqZT7ittiCuqmwWic2W06h5Flo7LhSMBfrrSpe5i7yt6jSo-tuydZ-Sqd6i0h01NSahX7hC5HK52mlG4B7mh4gV0rQw_FDo2QFHXOg5uUK_7_4c_e1mD4j69yiafDikK_l6tTCA4yVRBI9t0kfltH2xoCH6GdwW9s) the appointment of Kim Kardashian as "chief taste consultant." This is a decorative position that involved a series of commercials with a celebrity. “Recently, I have been paying more and more attention to plant-based meats and I can say that Beyond Meat is my absolute favorite. Their products are not only delicious, but also useful for me and my family, ”Kardashian commented on her appointment.

News of a new "Chief Flavor Adviser" sent Beyond Meat stock up 7% in an instant. Soon, attentive viewers [noticed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniesoteriou/kim-kardashian-roasted-pretending-eat-beyond-meat) that during the filming, Kardashian never tried a dish with vegetable meat: every time a celebrity had to take a bite, the frame changed. Papers Beyond Meat on the day of the release of the video in Kardashian's Instagram fell by 11%.

Market for "green" cutlets
--------------------------

Despite Wall Street's positive attitude towards plant-based food stocks, experts [are pointing](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/14/plant-based-food-stocks-beyond-meat-oatly-face-a-reset.html) to an imminent decline in performance across the industry. The pioneers were Beyond Meat and plant-based milk producer Oatley, with the latter's stock currently down 80% from its IPO price.

Experts say that the reason for the cooled demand for plant-based replacements of familiar products is not even difficulties with logistics and rising inflation, but a general loss of interest in this category of goods. Kellog notes that during the company's work, they have repeatedly encountered a similar increase in the popularity of a product. “Explosive growth is always followed by a turbulent period,” explained Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane during the presentation of the financial report. His company owns Morningstar Farms, the largest player in the US herbal market. Morningstar Farms holds approximately 27%, Beyond Meat 20%, and Impossible Foods 12% of the US market.

Plant-based meat sales have indeed stagnated throughout the year, Nielsen found. Over the same period, sales decreased by 5.8%. “There will be competition for who can scale the business the fastest, for market share, sales and customer attention,” predicts Chris Dubois, senior vice president at IRI consulting agency.

At the end of 2021, the decline in financial performance was [demonstrated](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-beyond-meat-stock-plant-based-boom-underperforming/) by the vegetable division of the Canadian Maple Leaf Foods. In 2017, the company acquired several brands of herbal products at once with the aim of entering a fast-growing market. Sales in the chilled plant-based meat category did see explosive growth in 2019 (59%) and 2020 (75%). Growth turned to stagnation in 2021, with category sales up just 1%. In November of the same year, the head of Maple Leaf Foods stated that "Over the past six months, we have seen an unexpected and sharp decline in the growth rate in the vegetable protein category." Sales, according to the top manager, also stopped growing, and the decline was 6% instead of growing by 30%. The head of Maple Leaf Foods [believes](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23065941/vegan-vegetarian-plant-based-food-tech-bad-products)that again broken supply chains were to blame, which prevented the production, packaging and delivery of all ordered products: the needs of consumers were not met, and they simply did not repeat purchases.

However, not all companies are doing so badly. Impossible Foods told reporters that sales revenue in the fourth quarter of last year increased by 85%. Eat JUST, the largest supplier of plant-based chicken egg replacements in the US, also saw a two-fold increase in sales amid rising prices for conventional eggs. Analysts are confident that, despite the difficulties, the market for plant-based alternatives to animal products will stabilize in the perspective of one to two years. “I think during this time we will see the formation of real leaders in this industry,” Dubois sums up.

Vegetarian inflation
--------------------

The position of Beyond Meat and other manufacturers of alternative meats may change along with the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment. So, for example, New York Times columnist Anneliese Griffin [believes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/02/opinion/inflation-vegetarian-vegan.html) that inflation will soon make US residents vegetarians. In just a year, the food basket in the US has risen in price by 10.8%. At the same time, vegetables and fruits became more expensive only by 7.8%, dairy products - by 9.1%, and meat, fish, poultry and eggs - by 14.3%. In a year, the average American eats about 124 kg of meat, which is 44 kg more than in Europe. If current inflation rates continue and Americans do not change their eating habits, they will spend $20 billion more on meat, poultry, fish and eggs this year than they did in 2020.

Another factor that can ensure the stable growth of the alternative meat market is ecology. In the journal Annual Review of Resource Economics, a study was published, according to which in developed countries, meat consumption should be reduced by at least 75%. If meat consumption increases, the planet will collapse. “If all the inhabitants of the Earth start eating as much meat as Americans and Europeans, we will definitely not achieve the goals of the program to curb climate change, and entire ecosystems on the planet will simply disappear. Thus, we should reduce meat consumption, ideally to 20 kg per year or even less,” [says](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2022/05/04/meat-consumption-must-fall-by-75-in-rich-countries-argue-researchers-are-vegetarian-diets-for-all-the-solution) Dr. Matin Kaim.

To encourage consumers to switch to a vegetarian diet, Kaim advises raising taxes on meat production. According to his idea, the activity of livestock farms is costly to the planet, and this should be reflected in the price of the product. Now about half of all grain produced on earth is used as feed for farm animals. The conflict in Eastern Europe has led to shortages in the supply of grain, and this could significantly speed up the process of moving away from meat. And if in 2020 the total revenue of artificial meat producers was $6.6 billion, then by 2026 it may [exceed](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/877369/global-meat-substitutes-market-value) $16.7 billion.
