The S&P 500 index has already crossed the border separating it from the bear market zone on Friday. Although the S&P 500 leveled off and exited almost immediately, analysts believe that a bullish scenario should not be expected. The NASDAQ Composite Index, made up of technology stocks, has been in the bear zone since March.

Several factors came together in the market:

*   Inflation is on the rise and investors fear that the Fed's efforts to contain it could lead to a sharp slowdown in economic growth, which will hit corporate profits and, consequently, the value of companies on the stock market.
*   Prices are also rising due to strong demand for goods amid supply chain disruptions exacerbated by coronavirus lockdowns in some Chinese cities.
*   Chip shortages have pushed up the cost of electronics and cars.
*   The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has led to a sharp rise in energy prices.
*   Rising prices have reduced the purchasing power of consumers, which is why the profitability of companies is falling.
*   To curb inflation, the Fed began raising interest rates. Because of this, it is more profitable for investors to invest in bonds and even deposits than to take on the long-term risk of owning stocks, such as technology companies.

Will there be a recession

According [to](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-17/bofa-clients-hoard-cash-at-2001-high-as-stagflation-woes-surge) a survey of fund managers conducted by Bank of America, investors believe that the market is prone to an inevitable rally in a bear market, but that the final lows have not yet been reached. With further rate hikes expected from the Fed, the market has yet to capitulate, said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America. The poll showed that fears of a recession outweighed the risks associated with inflation and the conflict in Ukraine.

At the same time, Bank of America published a forecast earlier, according to which the S&P 500 index has not yet reached the bottom and the markets are waiting for many months of pain. According to Hartnett, the market decline may end in October 2022, when the S&P will be at the level of 3000 points. For most of this year, the market will be affected by an inflation shock, a rate hike shock, and a recession shock, leading to negative yields and heightened volatility.

“Market participants are bearish – a necessary condition for a sustainable low, but not sufficient. With upside risks just emerging, it is still too early to be bullish,” [wrote](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-23/morgan-stanley-s-wilson-says-too-soon-to-turn-bullish-on-stocks) Morgan Stanley led by Michael Wilson.

The U.S. equity market is considered to be entering a bearish phase when major broad indices such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop 20% from their highs. This is an unofficial definition - it's just what Wall Street experts call among themselves the situation when the markets collapsed.

It is also necessary to distinguish such a drop from a correction, which is the term for a decrease in the price of an asset by at least 10% compared to the most recent peak. A correction often symbolizes nothing, and many investors view it as a signal to buy at a lower price.

Experts are wary of the establishment of a bear market, as it often precedes a recession. If a bear market simply describes a decline in the value of the stock market, then a recession is already a general decline in the production of goods and services in the country.

There have been 17 bear markets since the Great Depression until the end of 2020, nine of which were accompanied by recessions, according to investment firm Invesco. Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson also wrote that Wall Street indices predicted nine of the last five recessions.

Experts at Morgan Stanley believe that the S&P 500 index may fall even lower and fall to the level of 3400 points after the end of the reporting season in the second quarter. “Until then, brutal bear market rallies should be used to ease the situation in sectors most vulnerable to the coming decline in earnings,” analysts said.

“Financial conditions are just starting to tighten,” [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-19/goldman-s-kostin-says-stocks-pricing-elevated-odds-of-recession) Charu Chanana, market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “Markets are still digesting all the nuances of the pandemic, supply issues and inflation – and now that there are risks of stagflation, I think this is just the beginning!”

“According to the general consensus from now on, economic growth will slow down, a recession will occur for the foreseeable future, interest rates will continue to rise, and inflation should decrease but remain high,” [said](https://www.ft.com/content/5ab84b8f-61a3-4c04-a9e6-bae91e98e49d) Emiel van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Legal & General Investment Management.

Other analysts believe that investors' fears about an imminent recession in the US are exaggerated, and stocks may recover within a year.

“A recession is not inevitable. Fluctuations in the US stock market indicate that investors are evaluating the increased chances of a downturn compared to recent economic data,” said Goldman Sachs strategists [.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-19/goldman-s-kostin-says-stocks-pricing-elevated-odds-of-recession)

The relative dynamics of cyclical and defensive stocks suggests a sharp slowdown in growth, which is not confirmed by the data of the ISM manufacturing index, [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-19/goldman-s-kostin-says-stocks-pricing-elevated-odds-of-recession) Goldman Sachs' David Kostin. According to his calculations, there is a 35% chance that the US economy will enter a recession within the next two years.

According to [the](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-16/jpmorgan-s-kolanovic-says-stock-markets-overprice-recession-risk) UBS Group model, the stock market estimates the probability of an economic downturn at 40%.

JPMorgan's Marko Kolanovic [expects](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-19/goldman-s-kostin-says-stocks-pricing-elevated-odds-of-recession) U.S. equities to improve, with no recession this year due to some summer pickup in consumer activity amid reopenings and China's tightening of monetary and fiscal measures.

Credit Suisse also agrees with this opinion. “Investors should not sell at market lows in a panic,” [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-19/goldman-s-kostin-says-stocks-pricing-elevated-odds-of-recession) Michael Strobeck, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse. “Once real returns peak, there is potential for a quick recovery.”

HSBC experts [cut](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-19/goldman-s-kostin-says-stocks-pricing-elevated-odds-of-recession) their year-end forecast for the S&P 500 to 4450 due to the risk of a serious slowdown in growth, although this estimate also suggests a recovery rather than a further fall.

Deutsche Bank US equities and global strategist Binky Chadha also lowered his forecast and allowed the S&P 500 to fall to 3,000 if a recession does come. However, the baseline scenario does not yet imply an imminent recession, and the S&P 500 index could rise to 4,750 points by the end of 2022, according to Deutsche Bank.

**How long does a bear market usually last?**

The previous bear market began in early 2020 amid a downturn in economic activity due to the coronavirus. The Dow [returned](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stock-markets-dow-update-3-26-2020-11585196225?mod=e2tw&mod=article_inline) to the bullish zone in March of that year in just 11 days. [It took](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-crashed-the-stock-market-a-year-ago-here-are-some-lessons-learned-11615113001?mod=article_inline) the S&P 500 126 trading days to go from a record high to a bear market and back to a new high.

The current situation is not as critical as it was then. This year, the S&P 500 is still up about 75% from its 2020 low as of May 20.

However, bear markets are rarely as brief as they are in 2020. According [to](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/sp500corrbeartables.pdf) Yardeni Research, the bear market lasted 517 days between 2007 and 2009. The previous one, from 2000 to 2002, lasted 929 days.

At the same time, the American market often walks on the edge. In both 2011 and 2018, the S&P 500 fell 19% due to sell-offs. Although several sectors, as well as some other indexes, have fallen more than 20%, the S&P has not technically fallen into a bear market.
