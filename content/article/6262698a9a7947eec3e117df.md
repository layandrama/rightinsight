Fiber is a type of complex carbohydrate that the human body cannot digest. It is found in plant products: fruits, berries, vegetables, cereals, cereals, legumes, nuts and seeds. In plants, fiber essentially performs the same function as the human skeleton - it supports the structure of a single organism.

Why do we need fiber: 4 key reasons
-----------------------------------

Until the second half of the 20th century, fiber was considered a ballast substance that is not of particular importance to humans, so the body simply removes it along with other waste products. In the 1970s, Irish surgeon Denis Burkitt questioned the idea. Burkitt and colleagues suggested that a lack of dietary fiber in the diet [may be associated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28583217/#:~:text=Campbell%20and%20Hugh%20Trowell)%2C%20a,as%20cancer%2C%20appendicitis%20and%20diverticulosis.) with the risk of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, tooth decay, gastrointestinal cancer and diverticulosis. In the future, their hypothesis found a lot of evidence in studies.

### Fiber and diabetes

Eating foods rich in fiber [may reduce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2992213/) the risk of type 2 diabetes. Like many chronic diseases, diabetes is associated not only with genetic predisposition, but also with lifestyle, including nutrition. Research into the role of legumes and whole grains in the human diet is particularly [encouraging .](https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(17)30106-1/fulltext) The soluble fiber found in these foods slows down the movement of food through the intestines, preventing sudden changes in blood sugar levels, a potential trigger for the development of diabetes. For people who have already been diagnosed with diabetes, these foods help control glucose and insulin levels, which can help prevent complications of the disease.

Overweight and obesity are also considered risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. Getting enough fiber in your diet helps you maintain a healthy weight. The famous Framingham Study [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2954448/?report=reader) that eating whole grains was associated with lower body fat. It was 10% lower in people who ate three servings of whole grains a day, compared to those who did not have such foods in their diet at all.

### Fiber and cholesterol

Soluble fiber is able to “absorb” excess cholesterol in the intestines, preventing it from entering the bloodstream. Oatmeal dietary fiber (beta-glucans) was the first [to show](https://www.jandonline.org/article/S0002-8223(09)01813-6/fulltext) this miraculous effect . Similar properties also have fiber, which is found in apples, carrots, pearl barley and legumes. A diet with a large proportion of plant foods can [reduce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551487/#!po=59.9099) the level of "bad" cholesterol by 30% - low-density lipoproteins, which can be deposited on the walls of blood vessels and increase the risk of atherosclerosis.

### Fiber and intestines

Fiber also helps maintain normal bowel function. For example, one of its types, cellulose, increases the volume of the stool and softens its passage through the intestines. Wheat bran, whole grains, vegetable and fruit peels contain cellulose and play an important role in preventing constipation. In addition, fiber [stimulates](https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4131.long) the contraction of the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, which can be useful in the prevention of hemorrhoids, appendicitis and diverticulosis.

According to the National Medical Research Center of Oncology. N.N. Petrov, bowel cancer annually ranks third among oncological diseases after lung and breast cancer. Worldwide, 1 million new cases of this disease [are recorded every year.](https://ci5.iarc.fr/CI5-XI/Default.aspx) A meta-analysis published in The BMJ showed that every 10 g of fiber in the daily diet [reduced the risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3213242/?report=reader#!po=14.3678) of rectal cancer by 10% \[9\]. Because of this, nutrition experts recommend eating at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, and including whole grains and legumes in your diet. But alcohol, red meat, sausage and smoked meats should be limited - they [increase the risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3669681/) of bowel cancer.

Although the enzymes of the human gastrointestinal tract cannot digest fiber, it is food for the bacteria living in the intestine. The intestinal flora contains from 500 to 1000 different types of bacteria. All of them feed on different types of fiber and produce fatty acids that protect the intestinal walls from damage and inflammation. The more different bacteria there are, the better the body is protected from pathogens, allergic reactions and autoimmune diseases. After all, the gut is the largest organ of the immune system.

How to help the intestines work better? There are foods that contain fiber. The largest microbiome study, American Gut , [found](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180515092931.htm) that people who eat more than 30 different types of plants per week have a more diverse microflora than those who eat fewer than ten types of plants.

### Fiber and heart health

Cardiovascular diseases are traditionally the leading causes of death: according to Rosstat, they account for almost half of all deaths in Russia, and [every fourth](https://rosstat.gov.ru/folder/12781) dies from coronary heart disease (CHD). Three large cohort studies [have found](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/fiber#cardiovascular-disease-prevention) that a sufficient dietary fiber intake can reduce the risk of coronary artery disease by 16–33%. In general, every 7 g of fiber in the daily diet reduces the likelihood of cardiovascular disease by 9%. The greatest effect is believed to be provided by the use of dietary fiber, which is found in cereals and fruits.

How to get enough fiber
-----------------------

The daily norm of fiber for men is 38 g, for women - 25 g. Most of it is found in legumes: peas, lentils, kidney beans. The US National Institutes of Health [recommends that you](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/) include at least one to two servings of cooked or canned legumes in your diet each week. A serving is two tablespoons. Dishes such as pea soup, lobio or lentil pâté are great for this item.

Another valuable source of fiber is unrefined cereals. The leaders are oatmeal, buckwheat, pearl barley, bulgur, quinoa and brown rice. It is advisable for women to eat at least three servings of whole grains per day, for men - four. In this case, a serving is half a glass of boiled cereal (80–90 g). For those who do not have time to cook porridge, whole grain bread, popcorn without additives, or bread with the addition of second-class flour can be a substitute.

A key element in the set of fiber norms is vegetables and fruits. The UK National Health Service [suggests](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/5-a-day/why-5-a-day/) including them in every meal and eating at least five servings of vegetables or fruits a day \[14\]. To correctly determine the volume of one serving, be guided by the size of your fist. You can eat any vegetables and fruits: fresh, cooked, canned and frozen.

To maintain a variety of fiber sources, add nuts to your diet. The leaders in the content of dietary fiber are almonds, pistachios and hazelnuts. 60-75 g of different nuts per week is enough to supplement healthy fiber snacks.

If there is too much fiber
--------------------------

Health organizations do not set an upper limit of normal for dietary fiber. However, busting can happen if you use dietary supplements with fiber. They, by the way, do not have most of the beneficial properties that are present in the fibers from food. Also at risk are followers of extreme plant-based diets, such as raw foodists. Due to an excess of fiber, they may develop stones in the gastrointestinal tract. But if a person eats in a balanced way, he is physically unable to get an “overdose”.

Don't drastically increase your fiber intake and remember to drink plenty of fluids, as this can lead to unpleasant symptoms such as abdominal cramps, bloating, and increased gas. Sometimes there is individual sensitivity to certain types of fiber. In this case, it is worth recording the body's reactions to certain foods in a food diary. It will not be superfluous to consult a gastroenterologist.
