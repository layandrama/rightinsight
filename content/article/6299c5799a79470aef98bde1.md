“The most important part of my success is that I never quit,” [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hp3OdeDGxg) Donald Freese, referring to his loyalty to the business he chose decades ago. He emphasizes that the decision to work in some area should be made for life, and he did so by associating himself with the glass business.

The beginning of the life of the future billionaire was more than modest. Freese, born in Pennsylvania in 1940, was the third of 13 children in the family. The family lived so poorly that when he was five years old, Donald and one of his brothers were sent to an orphanage by their parents. At the age of 12, Freese went to work on a dairy farm, then raised pigs and vegetables on other farms. “There I learned what work is,” the entrepreneur recalls. “He worked from dawn to dusk.”

Ode to glass
------------

After graduating from school, in 1958, Freese went into the army for three years. The Korean War had ended by that time, and the Vietnam War had not yet begun, so the young man served in Okinawa and Taiwan. He liked the service. “I had more freedom during my service than I ever have in my life,” he laughs.

After the army, the young man decided to go to California - if only not to go back to the farm in Pennsylvania. He only had $125 at the time. It was necessary to look for work, and he [got](https://labusinessjournal.com/news/weekly-news/glass-forges-newest-billionaire/) a job in Los Angeles at a small company CR Laurence, becoming the seventh employee there. It was 1961. Freese was getting $2.5 an hour. The company was engaged in an unremarkable business, the production of accessories for glass - various fasteners, frames and other things. According to the memoirs of the entrepreneur, all he thought then was how to pay rent for housing.

Frieze liked the job. He became interested in ordering suppliers, compiling catalogs, and serving customers. At the same time, he was bending his back in the warehouse like a simple worker. “I did everything possible to make customers want to do business with us,” says the entrepreneur. Freeze knew how to work, so he soon became an indispensable person for the owner of the company, Bernie Harris. Harris increasingly worried that Freese would leave and form a rival company. “I think he wanted me to be in his company and not in another,” Freese suggests. And a few years later, Harris sold him 10% of the business for $10,000. The price was low: when Freese joined the company, its annual revenue was only $240,000.

However, Freese still did not intend to stay in this business for a long time. But the opinion changed after he saw how much demand for CR Laurence products was becoming. In the US, more and more high-rise buildings were being built that needed to be glazed. Growing not only sales of real estate, but also cars, which also used glass. “This glass business looks really good,” he said to himself then. Everywhere I look, I see glass. In my car, in my house, in industry. I don't think there will be an end to it." So the entrepreneur decided to stay in business, gradually increasing his stake in CR Laurence.

Shower with soul
----------------

A feature of Friz's approach to business development was the search for and even the creation of new niches for the use of glass. The entrepreneur claims that it was his company who came up with the idea to make all-glass shower doors. Such doors needed fasteners, the production of which was just taken up by CR Laurence. “We were pioneers here, and now it's a big market,” Freese says proudly.

The company has also mastered the production of fixtures for sliding glass doors in offices. These space-saving doors were also new and kept CR Laurence busy. The company also began to produce fixtures for transparent partitions in offices, which were also becoming more and more popular, as well as for glass railings. In parallel, Friz developed the production of tools for working with glass, materials for its polishing and accessories for transportation. The company also produced frames for automotive glass, bulletproof windows that were installed in banks, as well as for shop windows.

In addition, CR Laurence developed door frames with sensors that determined whether the door was open or closed. They were used for front doors in organizations for which security was important. In order for customers to save on heating or cooling costs, the company has made special doors that provide high thermal insulation. At the same time, she began to offer materials for thermal insulation of houses.

Freeze was wrong. Glass was indeed required everywhere. By 1997, the company's annual sales reached $ 100 million. In the same year, Freese completely bought out CR Laurence from the former owner, Bernie Harris, who by that time had retired.

Freese used the economic crisis of 2007-2008 to buy up less successful competitors. An important acquisition in March 2008 was the [purchase](https://www.glassonweb.com/news/cr-laurence-acquires-sommer-maca) of Sommer & Maca, a manufacturer of glass processing equipment. It was a longtime competitor of CR Laurence. And in 2011, the entrepreneur bought the bankrupt US Aluminum of Monterey Park and acquired an asset in the aluminum industry, whose products CR Laurence actively uses to produce its fasteners. Freese expanded the geography of business: in addition to the United States, the company began to work in Canada, Europe and Australia.

The main companies operating in the glass fittings market in the United States are EFCO (window frames are among the main products), NanaWall (stained glass), Simonton (window frames and glass doors), Kawneer (produces extra strong frames for houses hurricane-prone regions, especially Florida and Texas), Arcadia Custom (luxury window frames and doors). The market is recovering from the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of 2021, sales of the 50 largest US glazing companies [increased](https://www.glassmagazine.com/article/top-50-glaziers-2022) to $3.8 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2020. However, the industry is facing rising material costs, supply chain issues and raw material shortages.

Made employees millionaires
---------------------------

In the early 2010s, when Friese turned 70, he began to think about who to transfer the business to. And I realized that there was no one. His son, according to the entrepreneur, was not ready to manage such a large company. “I often joked that if something happened to me, my wife would run the company,” says the entrepreneur. “I love my wife very much, she is a wonderful person, but she does not know business.” So Freese began preparations for the sale of the company.

The difficulty was that the entrepreneur was not going to just get rid of CR Laurence, having received the money. “I wanted to make sure that whoever bought the company, we were allowed to continue running it, so that everything was kept intact and employees were not fired,” Freese explains. Therefore, he rejected the proposals of private investment companies - after the purchase, anything could wait for the company.

As a result, in 2015, when the revenue of CR Laurence was already $570 million, he sold it to Oldcastle Building Envelope. It was profile - it produced, in particular, metal frames for windows. This is a division of a large Irish manufacturer of building materials CRH Group. The deal amounted to $1.2 billion in cash. Freese, as he wanted, remained CEO, retaining the bulk of the real estate of his native company in his ownership.

In parting, the entrepreneur made a generous gift to 1,400 CR Laurence employees who had worked in it for at least a year. He sent them checks—an average of $60,000 each. In total, the entrepreneur spent about $86 million on this. “It was the employees who made the company the leader it is now,” he says. “And they deserve recognition and rewards.” Freeze always hated it when entrepreneurs said goodbye to employees, “Well, you did a good job, so thank you,” because “thank you” does not help the employee’s children buy a house or pay for education.

To two employees who had worked for him for a particularly long time and managed warehouses, he personally delivered checks for a million dollars. "I don't think 'thank you' is enough," he told them. “There are employees that you know are doing more for you than is required,” Freese explains. “They were just like that.”

But the entrepreneur is not going to transfer all his fortune to his three adult children and plans to donate part of it to charity. He is generally not inclined to spend his fortune. His only expensive purchase was a house in Malibu (the city is famous for the fact that Hollywood stars live there). This was requested by his wife - they are going there for the weekend.

Despite a personal [fortune](https://www.forbes.com/profile/donald-friese/?list=billionaires&sh=266f41ca953f) of $1.1 billion, Freese continues to go to work six days a week. Usually he is at the office by six in the morning, and arrives home at 18:30. “This is my life,” the entrepreneur explains. Nothing compares to being successful in your business. I'm going to work as long as I can."

**“The glass shower market is booming right now”**

_Rinat Mulyakaev, Technical Director of Glass Furnitura Trading LLC_

“The Russian market for fittings for glass structures has not yet reached its peak. Despite the pandemic, demand remained stable in the country, but now there is a reorientation of customers towards cheaper and, as a rule, lower quality products. In recent years, several suppliers of such goods have appeared. The market is expanding. Glass structures are installed everywhere: entrances, offices, shopping malls, transport infrastructure facilities, housing and, of course, private houses. The effect of a wave is clearly visible, when modern trends in construction go from West to East. With proper funding in the regions, we will see growth for some time to come.

Demand in various areas is dynamically changing. The market for glass shower enclosures is now booming, and sliding doors have become less interesting. There is still a growing interest in stationary and transformable office partitions, as well as in proven additions to the facade of the building - glass canopies. However, all-glass railings without extra metal racks remain the most popular on the market. More and more glass will be in the appearance of buildings - facades, canopies ... There will be more and more glass structures with built-in illumination.
