“So we have a camera, I have a pocket,” says Steve Jobs, pointing to his blue jeans. September 7, 2005, San Francisco: The Yerba Bueno Center for the Arts hosts another Apple product presentation on this day, and it is traditionally led by the founder and head of the company. Behind him is a screen on which the operator brought a close-up of Jobs. “In this,” he continues, pointing to a large pocket, “we usually carry an iPod or iPod Mini, they fit perfectly in there.” Then he points to the small "fifth pocket" of the jeans. “Does anyone know why this pocket is needed at all? Jobs asks as the audience laughs. \- I've always asked myself this question. But now we know the answer because it's the new iPod Nano." Jobs takes a small white music player out of his pocket. The hall explodes with applause.

It was already the fourth iPod model, the first version of which was released in 2001. By and large, it was thanks to his appearance that Jobs gained fame as a visionary, and Apple presentations turned into one of the most anticipated and famous shows on the planet. More importantly, however, the iPod has literally revolutionized the IT industry and changed the way design, marketing, and advertising are perceived. In May 2022, the company announced that it was ending production of the legendary player - a good reason to remember how it was created and what, in addition to technical characteristics, helped it to remain a bestseller for many years.

"Electronic Jewelry"
--------------------

By the late 1990s, Apple found itself in a difficult position. The company that once launched the first mass-produced PC, the Apple II, and spearheaded the "computer revolution" in the late 1970s was now clearly outperformed by its eternal rival, Microsoft: Windows was wildly popular, and by 1997 the company [held](http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9806/12/upstarts.idg/index.html) an 86.3% share of in the operating system market. The share of MacOS, developed by Apple, gradually fell and amounted to only 4.6%. In the same year, Steve Jobs returned to the company after a 12-year break - the shareholders hoped that he would be able to "reanimate" Apple.


Indeed, the iMac released the following year became a bestseller: only from August to December 1998 it [was sold](https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Apple-Profit-Up-iMac-Sales-Cited-2952619.php#:~:text=25%2C%201998%2C%20reflect%20the%20runaway,computer%20store%20shelves%20in%20August.) about 800 thousand computers. But the iMac, with its stylish, futuristic design and powerful graphics processor, was still a "niche" product: first of all, it was bought by representatives of creative professions and those who wanted to stand out from the crowd. Apple's stability was not achieved. By 2000, demand for personal computers had fallen, and in the first quarter of 2001 the company posted a loss of $247 million, alarming analysts and investors. Jobs, on the other hand, seemed to remain completely calm and at the Macworld conference announced Apple's transition to a "digital hub" strategy. “We live in a new digital world with a huge number of digital devices. <...> And we believe that PCs, and especially Macs, will become the basis for our new lifestyle, in which digital technologies will play a major role, ”he said.

Meanwhile, Apple's Sacramento labs were hard at work on what would be part of the new strategy: the MP3 player. “We were looking for such a device for a long time so that it could be used in tandem with a \[computer\] Mac,” [recalled](https://www.fastcompany.com/3016520/an-oral-history-of-apple-design-1992-2013) Former VP of Hardware Engineering John Rubenstein. — We thought about cameras, but did not see how we can stand out \[in this segment\]. As for the PDA, we decided that at some point the phones would “gobble up” them. The music player market was the only one where we didn't have serious competitors. The products that existed then were terrible.” Indeed, at that time MP3 players were not very compact, their memory capacity was quite modest (for 6-12 songs), listeners often had to put up with technical problems, such as long pauses between tracks.

{{<ads>}}

But there was another, more prosaic reason that made Apple stop at the players. Rubenstein regularly traveled to suppliers' factories to look at their new designs and then possibly use them in Apple products. Among these manufacturers was Toshiba. During one of these visits to the Japanese company's factory, Rubenstein was shown a new compact hard drive that was 1.8 inches wide. Toshiba did not know what to do with it, but Rubenstein, immediately seeing the development potential, replied that Apple was ready to buy everything - thanks to such a hard drive, it was possible to make a more compact player with more memory. In January 2001, Rubenstein called Tony Fadell, former director of engineering at Philips and founder of the startup Fuse Systems, which was trying to build an MP3 player and an online music store. but did not succeed precisely because of the lack of a suitable hard drive on the market. Fadell joined Apple as a consultant, and so work began on the new player.

The first prototypes were ready in March. A model of the future player, the size of a pack of cigarettes, with characteristic rounded corners (the legendary head of Apple design, Jony Ive, believed that the device should not have straight and sharp corners) was presented to Jobs, and he immediately approved it. Marketing director Phil Schiller [suggested](https://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/vpervye-stalo-izvestno-kak-v-ipod-poyavilos-legendarnoe-koleso-prokrutki-05-11-2022) that only one change be made - to make a large scroll wheel on the body for navigating the menu, like the phone of the Swedish manufacturer Bang & Oluffsen. Subsequently, it became the most recognizable (and copied) element of the player's design.

They decided to make the front of the case from plastic, the back from titanium. Minimalist Ive insisted on a white color - at that time a lot of devices in bright colors began to come out, and such an appearance would help to stand out from the general background. “We thought, who needs another \[Sony\] Walkman? While the design was great, it was still just an MP3 player,” said Jeff Zwerner, former Apple packaging creative director. Name [invented](https://memeburn.com/2015/12/how-2001-a-space-odyssey-inspired-apples-mobile-device-line-up/) freelance copywriter Winnie Chico. He was inspired by the EVA space pods from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey - in English EVA Space Pod: the player, like these capsules, was innovative, worked independently, but at the same time could connect to the "main" large device (iMac took over the role of the space base). An i was added to the word pod, as was already done with the iMac, and the player received the name - iPod.

Jobs introduced the device at a press conference on October 23, 2001, sales started on November 10. From the beginning of work to the release of the iPod, only a little more than eight months passed. The memory size of the device was 5 GB, the display had a resolution of 128x160 pixels - in terms of technical parameters, the player was noticeably ahead of competitors' products (then the average memory size for large cases [was](https://appleinsider.com/articles/13/11/10/twelve-years-ago-today-apple-began-selling-ipod) about 64-128 MB). The price tag was appropriate. The first generation iPod [cost](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-10805019/iPods-selling-THOUSANDS-eBay-Apple-announces-discontinuing-20-years.html) $399, which was a lot for 2001.

The company explained the high cost of the novelty with the help of an ingenious and unusual advertising campaign for its time. So, the hero of the first commercial of the player listens to music on his MacBook and dumps the songs on the iPod, simply dragging the track names from one computer window to another. Then he continues to listen to the same song already on the player and, dancing, puts on a jacket and leaves the house. Without further explanation, the video clearly demonstrated the advantages of the device: the ability to quickly and easily download a large number of tracks, a beautiful, futuristic design, and compact dimensions. "iPod. A thousand songs in your pocket" is the only line that sounds at the end of the video. The choice of the song, Take California by the British duo Propellerheads, who worked at the intersection of techno and trip-hop, was also not accidental - energetic, but at the same time quite “dry”, minimalistic and, most importantly, fashionable sound perfectly matched the design of the iPod. Advertising posters were extremely laconic: a white background, a close-up photo of the iPod, the same slogan. All this contrasted sharply with the bright, catchy advertising of players from other 
manufacturers of those years.

Apple achieved its goal: in 2001, the company sold 125,000 iPods, which [became](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/from-walkman-to-ipod-what-music-tech-teaches-us-about-innovation/253158/) the fastest-selling MP3 player that year. Experts vying praised the technical characteristics of the device. “Just take your iPod out of your pocket and all your friends will immediately beg you to let me see it. But this gorgeous device doesn't just boast of a great look: its functionality and ease of use make it an outstanding product, even at a price,” [wrote](https://www.pcmag.com/news/a-look-back-at-pcmags-first-ipod-review) PCMag. Apple managed to make not just a player, but a fashion accessory. “While everyone else was trying to make a better, cheaper or faster MP3 player, Apple was creating an electronic “jewelry” that could play music,” [noted](https://www.besttechie.com/the-ipod-success-thank-the-marketing-department/)marketing consultant David Taber. "They \[at Apple\] never thought about price, but brought more innovation to the market, more style, and new ways to interact with digital media." Perhaps the only major drawback was the iPod's incompatibility with non-macOS computers.

However, this defect was soon corrected. Already in July 2002, the company introduced the second version of the player. The new iPod was compatible with Windows and was also available in 5 GB, 10 GB, or 20 GB storage options. In addition, for an additional $50, the case could be engraved with the autograph of Madonna, Beck, skateboarder Tony Hawk, or the No Doubt logo. In 2002, Apple [sold](https://history-computer.com/the-complete-history-of-the-ipod/) over 400,000 players. But sales in monetary terms amounted to only 2% of the company's revenue.

The most popular player in the world
------------------------------------

While the iPod was immediately hailed as a "revolutionary" device for the industry, it really took off after 2003. In April of that year, Apple, in addition to the new model of the player (its design has changed noticeably: the case has become thinner, the raised buttons have disappeared from the scroll wheel), introduced the iTunes Music Store online music store. Its main innovation was that the user did not have to buy the whole album, he could buy only one song he liked. “No one was selling songs for 99 cents back then. Nobody, by and large, just sold songs, - [recalled](https://www.wired.com/2010/04/0428itunes-music-store-opens/)later Jobs. “And then we came in and said we wanted to sell tracks a la carte.” The company, though not without difficulty, managed to conclude contracts with the "big five" record labels - BMG, EMI, Sony Music, Universal Music and Warner Music, thanks to which, by the time of launch , 200 thousand tracks [were available](https://www.cultofmac.com/478575/apple-history-itunes-music-store-opens/) in the iTunes Music Store library (for half a year this number doubled). The success was overwhelming: on December 15, 2003, the company announced that the number of songs downloaded from the iTunes Music Store had reached 25 million.

Of course, the presence of such a platform contributed to the active growth of iPod sales. Between October (when the Windows version of the iTunes Music Store appeared) and December alone, 730,000 players were sold, bringing iPod sales to 2 million since launch.

In 2004, seeing a new surge of interest in the device, Apple began to expand the iPod product line. In addition to the updated "classic" version, this time with a touch control wheel, there was an iPod Photo with a color display and an iPod Mini. The latter featured a more compact size (however, less memory), an aluminum case, presented in five colors - silver, pink, gold, green and blue. Plus, it was cheaper. If the "regular" iPod with a minimum amount of memory cost $299, then the iPod Mini is $249. That year, sales soared to 4.4 million players.

Diversification has become a critical element of the iPod strategy. Since 2004, each year Apple has released a new "full size" version, as well as players in other formats. In 2005, the iPod Shuffle was introduced, Apple's smallest non-display player at the time. At the same time, the second generation iPod Mini was released, but a year later it was replaced by the iPod Nano. The company took into account the requests of a wide variety of consumers: someone needed more memory, and someone was looking for a small device with which it is convenient to play sports. Annual updates helped fuel the interest of buyers. It was in those years that Apple's product conferences became a truly important event, which was expected no less than some big Hollywood premiere. At the same time, the distinctive design features of the devices remained unchanged - the control wheel and rounded corners.

{{< img src="r84tH3K.jpg" width="1200" height="675" caption="Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images">}}

Of course, stylish and memorable advertising campaigns played an important role in the success of the device on the market. In 2003, one of Apple's most famous commercials was released: on a bright background (green, blue, yellow or pink), black silhouettes of people danced, each of whom had a white iPod. The ad turned out to be so memorable and successful that for several years the company continued to release new videos and banners with silhouettes. At the same time, Apple began to attract musicians to cooperation, among which were such "superstars" as U2, Gorillaz, Daft Punk, Bob Dylan, and many aspiring artists. The diversity of music genres helped appeal to consumers with different tastes and supported the iPod's image as a versatile device that would suit everyone.[Josh Rabinowitz, vice president of marketing agency Gray Worldwide, admired](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/best-ipod-commercial-syncs-1235069303/) Apple commercials. “\[The company\] created a completely new, virtuoso neo-jingle – it didn’t sing about the quality of the product, the sound itself became part of its image.”

The dynamics of sales was more than impressive. In 2005, Apple sold 22.5 million iPods, in 2006 - already 39.4 million. In the same year, the share of player sales in the company's revenue structure reached a maximum of 40%. Apple's share of the portable music market [was close](https://money.cnn.com/2006/03/29/technology/apple_anniversary/index.htm) to 73%. Success in the new field helped the company renew its image and strengthen its brand over the years, as well as offset the decline in demand for personal computers.

End of an era
-------------

During these years, many manufacturers tried to release an "iPod killer", but in the end only Apple itself succeeded. In 2007, the company introduced a novelty - a smartphone with a touch screen iPhone, which combines the functions of a computer, telephone, camera and, among other things, a music player. The fact that not only the mobile phone market, but also the market for electronic devices and the IT sector as a whole would not be the same was immediately obvious. iPhones were being swept off store shelves at a speed never seen before and lined up in miles-long queues in front of stores: on the 74th day after launch, Apple announced that it had sold 1 million devices. Experts did not skimp on praise, including comparing the launch of a smartphone with the launch of the iPod - not in favor of the latter. “Just look at the five-year-old iPod,” [wrote](https://theweek.com/articles/459748/7-reviews-original-iphone-from-2007) time magazine. — Black and white display! Sticky control wheel! Now it looks like something a caveman carved with a piece of stone from another piece of stone."

{{<ads>}}

Obviously, the iPhone has eclipsed and, moreover, should have eclipsed the iPod. While the smartphone was released in June 2007, the touch-screen iPod Touch wasn't introduced until September and didn't stop the iPhone's triumph. The "push-button" iPod was also re-released and received the Classic prefix, the release of the Nano and Shuffle models continued.

Nevertheless, sales of the player continued to grow and in 2008 reached a maximum - 54.8 million units were sold that year. But the iPod's share of Apple's revenue has plummeted. In the fourth quarter of 2008, it [was](https://appleinsider.com/articles/08/10/27/ipods_accounted_for_just_14_2_of_apples_sales_in_q4_2008) already only 14.2%, while the iPhone accounted for more than 40%. And then cheap smartphones flooded the market, and the demand for players began to fall. iPod sales have gone down. Apple paid less and less attention to the product: after 2010, it stopped updating all models except for the iPod Touch (and even then new versions were not released every year). In 2014, the legendary iPod Classic was withdrawn from sale, at the same time the company stopped separating device sales into a separate category in its reporting. The share of the player in the revenue at that time barely exceeded 1%.

After 2017, only the iPod Touch remained, but the further, the more [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/jsqn8l/why_does_this_ipod_touch_still_exist_in_2020/) were raised by its presence in the Apple product line. The outdated gadget seemed to be simply lost among other devices of the company and was forgotten. And only on May 10, 2022, Apple announced the cessation of production of the player. “iPod is _finally_ dead”, “iPod _is officially_ discontinued” - the tone of most headlines eloquently testified that the player had long since become a sign of the past. "But even today, the spirit of the iPod lives on," said Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, not without some pathos.

Indeed, most of the products that have taken Apple from a laggard to a $2 trillion IT giant can rightly be considered the "progenitor" of the iPod. Its release back in 2001 helped lay the foundations for the company's visual language, its communication with customers and set the direction for Apple for many years to come: the corporation continues to set standards in the mobile device market, whether it be tablets, smart watches or wireless headphones, in design and marketing.

For many, the iPod turned out to be one of the symbols of the early 2000s, when music had to be “dumped” onto the player from a computer for a long time, Zoom and Twitter did not exist, and data privacy issues were not on the agenda. "Music ... games ... all memories are now in the past," social media users [lamented.](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/current-affairs-trends/apple-has-discontinued-the-ipod-after-2-decades-twitter-is-filled-with-nostalgia-8486551.html) With the iPod, an era has really gone. And it’s not easy to remember at least one gadget about which you can say the same thing.
