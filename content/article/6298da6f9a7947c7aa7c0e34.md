Saxo Bank's 'shocking' forecast for a return to hydrocarbons has become a reality
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Faced with soaring commodity prices and an increasingly improbable road to carbon neutrality, policymakers will take the unexpected and controversial step in 2022 to temporarily ease environmental restrictions on new investment in crude oil and natural gas for five and ten years, respectively. The plan will be promoted as the only pragmatic way to link the reality of our energy-intensive present to our desired low-carbon future, and limit the risk of social unrest caused by rising food and energy prices.”

[The Danish Saxo Bank presented](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/the-plan-to-end-fossil-fuels-gets-a-rain-check-02122021) such a “shocking” forecast in December last year. Even then, the crisis in the energy market was obvious, fuel prices were rising, but the relevance of the green agenda did not raise any questions. It seemed that ESG criteria and the rejection of hydrocarbon feedstock were firmly entrenched in the global investment community. The use of oil and gas was condemned in every possible way, and the energy transition process was actively promoted.

But the military conflict in Ukraine has changed a lot, complicating the "green" transformation of the economy, radically changing the landscape of the global energy industry. Despite Europe's desire to switch to completely "clean" energy, the region had to temporarily return to one of the most harmful fuels in terms of carbon dioxide emissions - coal.

Europe "temporarily" returns to coal
------------------------------------

Saxo Bank's first "shocking" forecast for 2022 came true at the beginning of the year, and although the bank cited other reasons for the world's return to renewable energy, plans to phase out fossil fuels had to be postponed.

In November 2021, the UN Conference on Climate Change COP26 was held, which resulted in the impression that the world was on the path to moving away from coal. At least 23 countries [have made](https://www.energymonitor.ai/sectors/power/should-we-be-worried-about-coals-resurgence) new commitments to phase out coal-fired electricity, including even Southeast Asian emerging economies Indonesia and Vietnam.

At the beginning of the year, the situation changed dramatically. As part of the sanctions, Europe first refused Russian coal, and then the import of oil transported by sea. In the context of strong energy price increases, which led to an additional burden on industrial enterprises and end users, Europe began to return to traditional energy sources.

A European Commission [paper released in May](https://www.cnbcafrica.com/2022/europe-admits-itll-have-to-burn-more-coal-as-it-tries-to-wean-itself-off-russian-energy/) , in which the region's authorities outline the goals of REPowerEU's clean energy transition plan, notes that "some of the existing coal capacity may also be used longer than originally thought." Also, a special place in the plan is given to nuclear energy and the use of domestic gas resources.

The capacity of coal-fired power plants in five leading European countries, including Germany, [increased](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/060122-factbox-ukraine-conflict-boosts-europes-clean-energy-ambition-amid-headwinds) by 27% in April compared to last year. Due to high gas prices in 2021, when the return to the use of coal-fired power plants began, carbon dioxide emissions under the European Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) increased by 7.3%.

Despite the abandonment of Russian coal, imports of this raw material to Europe this year are estimated to [grow](https://www.montelnews.com/news/1324647/europes-coal-imports-may-jump-44-this-year-analyst-) by 44%.

The UK, which closed the last coal mine in the country in 2015, has been declaring the need to launch a new mine since the fall of 2021, the 
capacity of which is [needed](https://www.npr.org/04.11.2021/1051444707/cop26-climate-summit-uk-coal-mine) for the country's steel industry.

This year, the country was supposed to close its coal-fired power plants as part of the coal-fired phase-out plan, but due to fears of a shortage of gas, the authorities decided to suspend this process. In the UK, they may also extend [the operation](https://www.energymonitor.ai/sectors/power/should-we-be-worried-about-coals-resurgence) of one of the nuclear power plants, which they previously planned to close.

In various European countries, authorities are beginning to return to the [use](https://www.energymonitor.ai/sectors/power/should-we-be-worried-about-coals-resurgence) of coal-fired power plants or consider this option as a last resort: in case of "emergencies that could threaten their energy security."

In the current environment, [GlobalData](https://www.energymonitor.ai/sectors/power/should-we-be-worried-about-coals-resurgence) predicts that by 2023 the demand for coal for the energy sector will increase further and exceed the record set in 2018.

At the same time, the European authorities are aware of the harm to the environment caused by burning coal, but in the face of high gas prices they cannot find an alternative solution.

Political implications of high energy prices
--------------------------------------------

Rising energy prices around the world have led to changes at the political level. The consequences of the confrontation between the West and Russia have shown how Europe is dependent on hydrocarbon supplies from Russia and vulnerable in case of their failure. Even the United States, which itself has oil and gas reserves, has suffered in this situation: the prices of gasoline, vital for automotive America, have jumped to [records](https://gasprices.aaa.com/) . Now the average price of gasoline in the US is $4.7 per gallon (1 US gallon - 3.8 liters), and this is the absolute [maximum](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/31/gas-prices-biden-approval-clean-energy/) for the time of observation.

The President of the United States, whose rating [has fallen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/31/gas-prices-biden-approval-clean-energy/) due to high fuel prices and general inflation, called the special operation in Ukraine one of the reasons for the rise in prices for Americans. The country introduced a ban on the import of Russian oil and gas.

Nevertheless, in order to reduce world oil prices, accelerating high inflation, the United States had to facilitate the entry of even more raw materials into the market. The country [released](https://edition.cnn.com/25.05.2022/business/gas-prices-biden-inflation-spr/index.html) 180 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves. oil in March, began talks with Iran about a possible lifting of sanctions and a return to the "nuclear deal" in exchange for additional oil supplies. Part of the US sanctions were lifted from Venezuela, allowing European and American companies to extract oil in the country, which was previously impossible.

The U.S. has also moved to [improve](https://www.ft.com/content/bb130bb9-4b75-4626-961a-2c1ed9b0e7f9) relations with Saudi Arabia, an influential member of OPEC, which is now able to increase production, although earlier there was a chill in diplomatic ties. Immediately after that, it became known that the country was ready to increase production to reduce world prices for raw materials, despite the fact that they had previously refused to do so. On June 2, OPEC+ announced that it was ready to increase oil production in July and August, which the organization had not agreed to since the beginning of the crisis.

And all these actions of the American authorities to increase the volume of oil on the world market take place against the background of the fact that the Biden administration was marked by active support for the green agenda. The country adopted an infrastructure plan, according to which the United States will switch to the use of "clean" energy.

In Europe, the authorities, finding themselves in conditions of limited energy resources and high prices, called for saving “every drop” of gasoline and lowering the temperature in homes.

In Germany, which is more dependent on energy resources from Russia and cannot abruptly abandon them under the threat of a recession, Chancellor Olaf Scholz was accused of not having a clear position on sanctions against Russia. Green parties [lamented](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/25/russia-climate-change-energy-spain/) that previous governments had failed to reduce the country's dependence on Russian hydrocarbons earlier. It seemed that fears of disruptions in energy supplies to the region split the political unity of Europe - the sixth package of sanctions, which included an embargo on Russian oil supplies by sea, was very difficult to accept because of Hungary's unwillingness to refuse to import raw materials.

Special operation in Ukraine will accelerate the development of green energy in Europe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If now Europe and the United States are forced to return to fossil fuels to ensure the operation of power plants, then in the long term a special operation in Ukraine will lead to [an accelerated refusal](https://www.eui.eu/news-hub?id=the-impact-of-the-war-in-ukraine-on-europes-climate-and-energy-policy) of Europe from hydrocarbons and especially Russian oil and gas.

E3G think tank spokesman Leo Roberts [notes](https://www.energymonitor.ai/sectors/power/should-we-be-worried-about-coals-resurgence) that the commitments made at the UN climate conference COP26 last year are long-term targets for phasing out hydrocarbons in the 2030s and 2040s. He is confident that the upward trend in coal consumption will continue only in the short and medium term.

The authorities of Western countries and experts [note](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/25/russia-climate-change-energy-spain/) that the current difficult period is a transition period, after which investments in the development of green energy will only intensify.

In the context of the most severe energy crisis and uncertainty, on May 18, the EU authorities [published](https://www.cnbcafrica.com/2022/europe-admits-itll-have-to-burn-more-coal-as-it-tries-to-wean-itself-off-russian-energy/) the REPowerEU hydrocarbon energy phase-out plan, which provides for additional investments in the development of alternative energy in the amount of €210 billion from 2022 to 2027. The share of renewable energy sources in the EU energy mix will be increased from the current 40% to 45% by 2030.

Europe wants to become carbon neutral by 2050. In the medium term, by 2030, the region [plans to](https://www.cnbcafrica.com/2022/europe-admits-itll-have-to-burn-more-coal-as-it-tries-to-wean-itself-off-russian-energy/) reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55%.

Countries will build infrastructure for hydrogen, wind, solar and LNG.

Now the rise in commodity prices and the fall of the US technology sector have led to a flow of investor funds into oil and gas stocks, which are even called the “new FAANG”. But the general trend of not investing in the oil sector continues among market professionals, [according to a](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/ukraine-russia-war-future-of-clean-energy) study by Morgan Stanley.

“Some 235 institutional investors, managing about $58 trillion in assets, have already committed to align their portfolios with carbon neutrality requirements. In addition, 92 banks, representing 40% of global banking assets, have pledged to “decarbonize” their lending and investment portfolios,” [said](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/ukraine-russia-war-future-of-clean-energy) Jessica Alsford, global head at Sustainability Research.

Investments in the development of oil and gas fields decreased from $740 billion in 2014 to $475 billion in 2019, and in 2020 they fell to $353 billion. In 2021, this figure did not increase significantly, Morgan Stanley notes.

Before the events in Ukraine, the bank predicted the growth of oil production in the world in 2022 and 2023 due to projects already underway. Then, according to the forecast, production will peak in 2024, after which it will begin to decline. In such a scenario, the supply on the oil markets will be insufficient, and prices will rise, regardless of geopolitical upheavals, the bank's experts say.

As a result, fossil fuels will [continue](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/ukraine-russia-war-future-of-clean-energy) to play a huge role in energy markets, even if green alternatives appear faster than expected, because the energy transition is important to consider not only the volume of demand, but also the possibility of supply, says Morgan Stanley.
