According to a [list](https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/almost-1000-companies-have-curtailed-operations-russia-some-remain#:~:text=Almost%201%2C000%20companies%20have%20publicly,to%20operate%20in%20Russia%20undeterred.) published by the staff of the Yale Institute for Senior Leadership, every second of 1,345 large foreign companies has suspended operations in the Russian market or completely left it. At the same time, one in six continues to work in Russia as usual. They are not afraid of public condemnation in the West or have found a way to externally comply with sanctions while continuing to develop. Experts identified three types of foreign companies that are not going to leave Russia in the near future. What allows them not to be afraid of pressure from their native countries?

All for the people
------------------

Foreign companies most often leave Russia under the pressure of public opinion in their countries. They choose to lose money by leaving the important Russian market for many, or by boycotting their products and stocks at home. It is quite difficult not to fall under any of these fires. For example, when the head of clothing chain Uniqlo, Fast Retailing Co. Tadashi Yanai, in an interview with the Nikkei newspaper , [said](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/13992059) that the retailer will continue to operate in the Russian market, since “clothes are among the items necessary for life,” posts with a hashtag [appeared](https://fortune.com/2022/03/09/uniqlo-owner-fast-retailing-slammed-decision-stay-russia-boycottuniqlo-movement/) on social networks calling for a boycott of Uniqlo. As a result, it temporarily suspended its activities in Russia.

However, countries and their societies differ greatly in their attitude towards Russia. If in the US the pressure on companies operating in Russia is very strong, then in France, Germany or Italy it is much weaker. In mid-March 2022, the head of the Union of French Entrepreneurs (MEDEF), Geoffroy Roux de Bezieu , [said](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5258648?) that French companies do not intend to stop working in Russia, as this will keep the work of about 160 thousand people. One of these companies is the Accor hotel group, which manages 55 hotels in the Russian market. Group CEO Sebastien Bazin [emphasizes](https://hoteliernews.ru/sebastyan-bazen-ceo-accor-obyasnil-pochemu-on-ne-zakroet-oteli-v-rossii/?) that over the past half century, his network had a chance to work in countries covered by hostilities, 30-40 times. “In our 50-year history, we have never stopped our activities, including in Myanmar last year, when there was a military coup,” he explained.

Later, the CEO [commented](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/14262579) that he did not know what could make him "make the decision to leave Russia." According to Bazin, Accor has never closed its hotels in conflict zones because the top manager's only concern is the company's employees. “Without them, we would not be able to work,” Bazin shared. “I love them all, and we have 3,800 employees in Russia.” Commenting on [the call](https://ria.ru/20220323/frantsiya-1779706086.html?) President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky to French companies to leave Russia, Bazin noted that he could close the business "even tomorrow morning", but does not believe that in reality his network is somehow contributing to instability in Ukraine. “No one can tell me that we are sponsoring the fighting,” he explained. — We do not pay taxes, because in Russia we incur losses, we now have a occupancy rate of 32%. And in order for us to earn money, it should be somewhere around 55%.

Refused to leave the Russian market and the German brand of chocolate Ritter Sport. A statement on the company's website [noted](https://www.ritter-sport.de/blog/2022/03/31/unser-statement/) that for Ritter Sport, "a medium-sized family business with 1,750 employees and manufacturing in Germany and Austria", Russia is the most important market after Germany. “In order to provide jobs and livelihoods for many cocoa growing families, we continue to supply chocolate to the Russian population, but have suspended all investment in Russia and advertising for several weeks,” the statement said. Ritter Sport noted that all profits from the current business in the Russian market will be donated to organizations providing humanitarian assistance.

The French dairy producer Danone also remained on the domestic market, although it suspended investments and stopped importing Evian water and Alpro vegetable drinks to Russia. In Russia, the company will leave basic dairy products, as well as baby and health food. “Our task in the current conditions is to provide consumers and patients with the food they need,” [said](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5240714?) Oleg Zharko, Regional Director for Corporate Affairs and Interaction with Government Agencies of JSC Danone Russia.

Non-outgoing retail
-------------------

French retailers Auchan and Leroy Merlin are also among the Western companies currently operating on the Russian market. Auchan CEO Yves Claude [explained in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche](https://www.lejdd.fr/Economie/le-pdg-dauchan-retail-international-partir-de-russie-serait-inimaginable-du-point-de-vue-humain-4101987) that the company will continue to operate in Russia because it acts in the interests of the civilian population. “The most important thing for us is to keep our employees and ensure that our main mission is to continue to feed the population,” he said. Claude added that he was ready to accept public opinion, which is contrary to the company's decision. According to him, about 30 thousand employees work in the Russian division of Auchan, and if the company leaves the market, then all these people will lose their jobs. “We act as a discounter and we believe that in times of high inflation we will contribute to protecting the purchasing power of the population,” Claude said. DIY retailer Leroy Merlin [said](https://www.rbc.ru/business/11/03/2022/622b46f59a7947ea4a1ef484) that, despite all the rumors, the company continues to work and does not plan to stop operations in Russia.

The German retailers Globus and Metro Cash & Carry also remained on the Russian market. In [an interview](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-konsumgueter/matthias-bruch-globus-chef-will-die-maerkte-in-russland-gegen-alle-widerstaende-offen-halten/28142512.html) with Handelsblatt, Globus CEO Matthias Bruch noted that the company employs 10,000 people in Russia, some of whom have been working online since its arrival in the country in 2005. “We feel a close connection with these people and we are responsible to them, as well as to our customers, despite political events,” he said. As a seller of products, Globus is responsible for people's basic needs, Bruch concluded. In a conversation with RBC, a representative of the press service of the Russian division of Globus noted that all the network's stores in Russia are operating as usual and there are no staff reductions.

Representatives of Metro motivated their intention to stay in a similar way. In an open letter to the team, the company's management noted that small retail stores and restaurants, which represent the majority of the retailer's customers, depend on it as a wholesale supplier. “The termination of Metro in Russia will have a strong impact not only on the jobs of 10 thousand people, but also on the business of 2.5 million self-employed people,” the letter says. Some Western fashion retailers have also remained on the Russian market, such as Italian Calzedonia Group (brands Calzedonia, Tezenis, Intimissimi, Falconeri) and Benetton Group (brands United Colors of Benetton, Sisley), French Etam. The companies did not make public statements about this.

Family business
---------------

Discussing why Western companies do not leave the Russian market, Mikhail Burmistrov, general director of the information and analytical agency INFOLine-Analytics, notes that some of the remaining companies are private. For example, Auchan and Leroy Merlin are owned by the Mullier Family Association family corporation, Globus hypermarkets are owned by the Bruch family, and Ritter Sport is owned by the Ritter family. “The level of pressure on private companies is less than on public ones,” Burmistrov states. The actions of public companies can instantly affect the value of shares, recalls Olga Sumishevskaya, partner of the consulting company One Story, co-founder of the Skolkovo NextGen service. But private companies are also obliged to comply with the strict instructions of their government, and the policy of the state, whose jurisdiction this or that company belongs,

Burmistrov points out that for companies such as Auchan, Leroy Merlin and Globus, the Russian market is an essential part of the business. “For Leroy Merlin, Russia is the largest business in terms of unit sales,” he elaborates. “In terms of money, taking into account the fluctuations in the exchange rate, it is less than in France, but in unit sales and in terms of growth it is more.” Over the past five years, the revenue of Leroy Merlin Vostok LLC (legal entity of Leroy Merlin in Russia) has increased: if in 2017 it [amounted](https://companies.rbc.ru/id/1035005516105-ooo-lerua-merlen-vostok/) to 226.6 billion rubles, then in 2021 - 456.6 billion. Also over the past five years, the company showed profit, in 2021 this figure amounted to 35.5 billion rubles, it increased seven times compared to 2020.

In 2021, Russia accounted for 10% of Auchan's global revenue, although the profit was much less, [said](https://www.lejdd.fr/Economie/le-pdg-dauchan-retail-international-partir-de-russie-serait-inimaginable-du-point-de-vue-humain-4101987) Claude Yves (Auchan's revenue in 2021 [amounted to](https://www.interfax.ru/business/834813) 229 billion rubles, net profit - 624.6 million rubles), but in 2022, the company expects sales to decline. The revenue of Hyperglobus LLC, the legal entity of Globus in Russia, has also grown over the past five years and in 2021 [amounted to](https://companies.rbc.ru/id/1047796876489-ooo-giperglobus/) 119.6 billion rubles, net profit - 4.2 billion rubles. “If they give up doing business in Russia, it will be a global blow for them,” Burmistrov said. “But they are facing serious pressure, and I do not rule out that they will have to make some decisions.”

Olga Sumishevskaya recalls that, regardless of the form of ownership, it is difficult for companies to abandon a business in which they have invested for years, especially if the country has a production facility that employs thousands of people, or the share of business is significant, and for example, 7–8% is already a significant share. “For many, Russia is a very profitable market,” Sumishevskaya continues, pointing out that Leroy Merlin sales in 2021 were almost 20% of global sales here, and most of the retailer’s own brands were produced in the country. And the share of Russia in the total business of Inditex (brands Zara, Bershka) [was](https://www.rbc.ru/business/05/03/2022/62233ae49a794700f74bc309?ysclid=l3tu1cgpb) about 8.5% in 2021 and was growing rapidly.

------------------

Some Western brands have remained in Russia due to franchise agreements. For example, the fast food chain Burger King developed in Russia according to this model. In an open [letter](http://www.rbi.com/English/news/news-details/2022/Actions-on-Burger-King-Russia/default.aspx)David Shire, head of Restaurant Brands International, who owns the brand, explained to employees that the company has three joint venture partners in Russia: entrepreneur Oleksandr Kolobov, Investment Capital Ukraine, one of Ukraine's largest investment firms, and VTB Capital. “We own a minority stake (15%) of the joint venture and none of the partners has a controlling interest,” the letter stated. According to Shir, the head office contacted the main operator of the business and demanded to suspend the activities of Burger King restaurants in Russia, but he refused. “There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any of the partners to simply leave or cancel all agreements,” Scheer explained. Would we like to immediately suspend all Burger King operations in Russia? Yes. Can we forcibly suspend activities today? Not". And although the company[announced](https://ria.ru/20220310/restoran-1777554440.html) the suspension of corporate support in the Russian market, including marketing and supply chains, and said it would not support requests for investment and network expansion in Russia, Burger King outlets continue to operate.

American company Yum! Brands, which owns KFC, announced on the suspension of investments in Russia and the closure of 70 of the chain's own restaurants. However, this did not affect the vast majority of the 1,000 franchise establishments in the chain. “In my opinion, international companies are not ready to completely leave Russia, and it is the franchising scheme that allows them to stay in the territory and continue their activities,” says Nina Semina, founder of the franchise catalog Franshiza.ru and the consulting company Francon. “They cannot open new restaurants due to reputational risks, but they continue to operate under old contracts, and this is a completely legitimate scheme to stay on the Russian market.” Semina adds that now the franchise development model is beneficial to two parties: for international companies, this is an opportunity to stay in Russia, for Russian entrepreneurs - to work under an international brand and according to international standards. However, there is also an example of the American network of Cinnabon bakery cafes, which opened new outlets in Irkutsk, Krasnodar and Moscow from March to May 2022.

We have a cancellation
----------------------

If they leave the market, it will be difficult for companies to return, because loyalty to their brands will be extremely low, and the longer they are absent, the less likely they are to return, Olga Sumishevskaya believes. The results of opinion polls also speak of a decrease in loyalty to departed brands: according to [a study](https://www.superjob.ru/research/articles/113416/kompanii/) conducted in March 2022 by the job search service SuperJob.ru, 77% of Russians admitted that, other things being equal, they would rather choose any other organization than a company that left Russia and then returned. They explained their position by political convictions (“I won’t go to traitors!”) And, in their opinion, by the greater reliability of companies that did not stop their activities in Russia (“Our people will not run away”). [According to](https://www.superjob.ru/research/articles/113388/pust-valyat/). In another study of the service, almost half of Russians (49%) were ready to completely or partially refuse to buy products from companies that announced they were leaving the Russian market due to a special operation. Every fourth (24%) was ready to completely abandon the products of companies that closed their business in Russia. Some respondents reacted emotionally: “Let them go!”, “I will even be against their return to Russia!”

“It cannot be said that the switch in demand will happen quickly, and this is where parallel imports can help,” Sumishevskaya said. “But the return of these companies to Russia will be a big question mark, as it will require even more investment than leaving.” Most likely, they will lose any privileges that the company receives when entering the market, the expert believes. The commercial director of the Interium digital agency Andrey Ermoshkin has a different opinion. “The practice of cancellation is not very popular in Russia (a way of socially ignoring people or companies.), therefore, most likely, if companies that left the Russian market and returned to it again are subject to condemnation, then it will be custom-made, because this is a very convenient tool that can spoil the reputation, ”he believes. Users are unlikely to start massively abandoning the products of these companies, Yermoshkin believes. “We see how everyone is waiting for the return of McDonald's or IKEA,” he concluded.
