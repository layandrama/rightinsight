William Deming loosely fits the stereotypical image of a business guru. Typically, writers on business thinkers choose charismatics such as Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. And this American scientist was engaged in the most boring subject - statistics. True, the conclusions that he drew from studying the processes within American corporations caused him a strong dislike of managers: companies recognized Deming's academic merits, but did not want to see him within their walls. On the other hand, Japanese factories, which decided after the Second World War to revive the destroyed industry, acted wisely: they invited not a yogi or a motivational speaker for consultation, as many of their current Russian colleagues would have done, but a scientist.

Deming is now considered to have had a greater impact on the country's business than any other person of non-Japanese origin. By the early 1980s, Japan overtook the United States in terms of the quality of cars, computers, clothing, household appliances, and this allowed Deming to return triumphantly to his homeland and receive an award from the hands of Ronald Reagan himself. What did this management theorist do?

Man without charisma
--------------------

Deming grew up in a small town in Iowa. The rural inhabitants of the state were characterized by thrift and aversion to waste, which [is believed](https://www.bl.uk/people/w-edwards-deming) to have influenced his views. After graduating in electrical engineering from the University of Colorado and then a PhD in mathematics from Yale University, he interned with energy companies and worked for the USDA and the US Census Department. On duty, he often had to study the work of the largest companies in the country. He was amazed at how rarely they think about saving. The habit of not caring about expenses, which originated in the roaring 1920s, did not leave American corporations even during the difficult years of the Great Depression.

Studying American businesses, Deming came to the conclusion that about 85% of business problems are due to poor management. For example, top managers have been the main reason why many corporations have failed to reduce the cost of their products while maintaining quality at a decent level. The education of managers did not imply a serious knowledge of statistical methods, and it was extremely difficult for them to understand into which “holes of inefficiency” money was flowing. The inability to optimize processes led to savings on the item of expenditure, on which it is just impossible to save - on raw materials and materials. Deming criticized [the established practice](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1993/12/23/japans-secret-w-edwards-deming/b69b8c00-4c5d-483a-b95e-4aeb1d94d2c6/) “Just Name Your Price”: When choosing among material suppliers, companies preferred those with the lowest prices. Frequent change of suppliers led to the fact that the final product was not uniform in quality. Deming believed that it was best for a company to work with one or two reliable suppliers, and not change them, tempted by discounts. A significant number of American companies chose to go bankrupt rather than look for ways to cut costs.

In the late 1920s, Deming came across the work of Walter Shewhart, a celebrated quality management consultant who experimented with applying statistical methods to manufacturing processes. Shewhart proposed to companies the so-called PDCA quality management cycle (according to the first letters of the English words "plan - do - check - act." The essence of the cycle was that an industrial company should constantly check how well the task was completed, based on the set KPIs, identify and analyze deviations, establish their causes and, as a result, adjust production so that everything corresponds to the planned indicators.

The Shewhart Cycle was widely accepted in companies, but it occurred to Deming to apply it to non-manufacturing processes, primarily to management activities. He was one of the first to put forward the idea that now seems obvious: people are a resource, and companies should constantly analyze what their working time is spent on. While working at the US Census Bureau, the scientist applied statistical process control to the work of employees, which contributed to a sixfold increase in their productivity. Equally high results were achieved by engineers for whom Deming taught courses on work efficiency.

In particular, the statistician criticized the dominant method of quality control in American industry: products were checked for defects only after they were manufactured. When a bad product rolled off the assembly line, the company had two options: either reject the product, wasting materials, labor, and money, or put it on the market, thereby risking alienating customers. The scientist considered both options harmful: the production process must be designed in such a way as to obtain a guaranteed quality product at the output. To do this, the verification system must be integrated into the production process.

Surprisingly, American corporations were not only not interested in these ideas, but even took Deming's conclusions with hostility. Thanks to the growth of industry during the Second World War, the country turned into a leading economic power, whose products were envied by the whole world. Companies saw no need for new approaches. A significant role was played by the fact that Deming was naturally [devoid](https://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/w-edwards-deming) of charisma. Success with the audience is most often achieved by experienced speakers who combine assertiveness with charm. And William Deming was described by the New York Times as "a tall, stern man who used to wear shabby three-piece suits and talk to senior executives like schoolchildren." “Can you blame competitors for your troubles? he scolded corporate managers who decided to come to his lecture. \- Not. You are to blame for everything."

Both his speech and his writings lacked sophistication. He could start a presentation to corporate managers with a vaguely worded question: "Do you have a constancy of purpose?" And he wrote his works in dry tautological language: “The prevailing style of management must undergo a transformation. The transformation is intermittent. It comes from understanding the deep knowledge system.”

Secret in a box
---------------

The breakthrough came by accident: after the victory over Japan, the occupying Allied forces invited Deming to help conduct a census in that country. He was soon contacted by the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers and asked for a series of meetings with Japanese business leaders. It turned out that the heads of local companies had heard a lot about his theories. Unlike American companies, Japanese companies were looking for ideas that would help them work more efficiently.

The Japanese believed that Deming would teach them the secrets of success held by US corporations, but instead he urged them to abandon many of the traditional attitudes of American companies. For example, from quarterly employee assessments that are typical for US businesses, leading to the “I want to be the hero of this quarter” philosophy. In his opinion, it interfered with the long-term goals of the company. Deming also preached that the key to solving problems in a particular industry is the labor force. It is the employee who can assess the state of affairs in the company like no one else. While American companies left quality control to external consultants and business analysts with no inside knowledge of the company, Japanese companies taught their employees to think that their proposed methods for improving work processes would be carefully studied by management and,

It is now generally accepted that the reasons for the success of Japanese technology firms in the second half of the twentieth century are rooted in the culture of the country. In an interview with RBC, one of the world's largest experts in lean manufacturing Jeffrey Liker told: "Traditionally, Japan has a very strong work ethic and commitment to accuracy... The Japanese are perfectionists: they honor high-class craftsmen and at the same time burn with the desire to surpass them." However, many of the principles that formed the basis of the Japanese management culture were formulated by Deming. For example, the scientist defined the main goal of any company as the continuous improvement of products and services. This principle has become part of the famous "Tao of Toyota", whose 14 points are suspiciously similar to Deming's list of the same number of points. It is also noteworthy that the zaibatsu, the corporations that dominated the Japanese economy before the war, did not differ in either perfectionism or a high work culture.

The impact that Deming's work had on Japanese companies has been documented. In the early 1950s, Ford Motor Company began to produce some of the gearboxes for its cars in Japan, at the Mazda plant (the company was among those actively consulted by Deming at that time). When Americans tried cars made in Japan, many of Ford's customers said they wanted them, even if it meant waiting months. Because both boxes were built to the same specifications, Ford engineers couldn't figure out the reason for the unpatriotic preference. Finally, they decided to take both products apart to try and find the differences. [It revealed](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manufacturing-innovation-lessons-from-the-japanese-auto-industry/)that the dimensions of the parts of the American box are within the established tolerances. But the dimensions of the parts of the Japanese boxes exactly correspond to those indicated in the drawings. Thanks to this, driving a car with a Japanese gearbox was smoother.

The contribution of Deming's ideas to the development of Japanese industry is recognized by such giants as Toyota, Sony and many others. He is even [called](https://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/w-edwards-deming) one of the people who shaped the world we are familiar with: the implementation of his ideas helped shift the economic center of power from the United States and Western Europe to Asia. Since 1951, innovators in Japan have been awarded an annual award named after the scientist.

Return to America
-----------------

Corporate America learned about Deming's success only in the late 1970s, when the country's market was flooded with Japanese brands. The economy of the great industrial power was in a deplorable state due to another crisis. The industrial cities of the United States were flooded with crowds of the unemployed, who found themselves without a livelihood due to the fact that many large companies made cuts or closed their enterprises. The trade deficit has skyrocketed: Americans have become accustomed to the idea that almost everything that used to be produced here, from light bulbs to sneakers, is now imported from Asia.

In the summer of 1980, NBC News aired an hour-and-a-half show titled "If Japan Can, Why Can't We?" It focused on the productivity gap between the US and Japan, as well as the sharp contrast in the quality of manufactured goods between the countries. Both comparisons were not in favor of America. The main character of the program was Deming. From that time began his recognition in his homeland. The television program attracted interest in the scientist, the largest corporations began to invite him for consultations. One of the first to hire Deming to reorganize manufacturing operations was Ford Motor Co., which was on the verge of bankruptcy. One of the results of this collaboration was the revolutionary Ford Taurus, which became one of the best-selling cars of all time. Other American firms that turned to Deming for help included Xerox,

It is believed that Deming became one of the key figures in the "quality revolution" in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, which helped the country regain its shattered technological leadership. In 1986, the scientist published the book "Out of the Crisis", in which he spoke about the style of thinking and practical techniques that led to the transformation of Japanese industry. The following year, President Ronald Reagan awarded the scientist the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. He led seminars for managers of large and medium-sized companies, and in 1993 founded the William Deming Institute, which promotes his ideas. That same year, the consultant died at the age of 93. He worked until his death: he held his last leadership seminar in Los Angeles just ten days before his death. Unlike many business gurus, he was committed to his own ideas in life,
