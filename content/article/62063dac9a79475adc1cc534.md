Each year, the United States hosts the Spam Grand American Championship, a recipe competition organized by Hormel Foods, owner of the Spam canned pork brand. In 2019, April Weinreich, a resident of Wacon, Minnesota, won. Her cheese, bacon, and, of course, Spam French toast beat out recipes from finalists in the other 25 states. Weinreich won a trip to the Hawaiian capital Honolulu for the annual Spam Jam festival. This is a large-scale holiday dedicated again to Spam canned food, which is an indispensable component of many Hawaiian dishes and one of the favorite foods of the inhabitants of the islands.

The competition has not been held for the past two years due to the pandemic. However, the brand, which will turn 85 in July 2022 and which has acquired the status of a legend during this time, has not suffered from it at all. On the contrary, in the months of the first lockdown, Americans began to urgently stock up on Spam banks: between March and June 2020, sales of the brand's products skyrocketed by 70%. Hormel Foods also reported record sales for Spam in 2021. However, this is just another proof that the product is able to successfully survive any catastrophe, both historical and reputational.

"Special Meat"
--------------

Spam's history dates back to 1891, when Chicago butcher George Hormel moved to Austin, Minnesota, and opened his own slaughterhouse and small meat processing business. George A. Hormel & Co. was incorporated in 1901 and later changed its name to Hormel Foods Corporation. The company grew, the assortment expanded: in 1926, Hormel's enterprise began to make canned ham for the first time in the United States, and two years later, canned chicken appeared. In the difficult year of 1929, when the Great Depression began, George Hormel ceded the post of head of the company to his son Jay.

However, the company released its main, most successful product only eight years later. The company developed a new recipe for minced sausage in order to increase production efficiency - not only hams were used, but also pork shoulder blades, which were not in demand among buyers. In addition to pork, the composition included water, salt, sugar and dye sodium nitrite. But the main innovation was the cooking method: all the ingredients were mixed in a vacuum, thanks to which the meat could be stored without a refrigerator for years before opening the sealed package. It was the first meat product of its kind for the American market. The laconic and sonorous name Spam was chosen during a competition held at Jay Hormel's New Year's party. The winner and the owner of the $100 prize was the actor and brother of the vice president of the company, Kenneth Degno: according to legend, he simply added the first and last letters of the phrase spiced ham (English "spiced ham"). However, later the company claimed that only Hormel himself and several other top managers knew the true meaning of the name.

The product was easy to store. Thanks to this, the novelty quickly fell in love with American housewives. Not the last role was played by aggressive advertising. So, on one of the first advertising posters, the word Spam [was repeated](https://arzamas.academy/micro/rekl/15) 21 times. The company also wanted to emphasize the versatility of the product - [it showed](https://books.google.ru/books?id=A0AEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=original+uses+of+SPAM&source=bl&ots=2dqBSMJTD7&sig=yZkNq1OG1YD2awWWDzN-8ouzLRo&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=original%20uses%20of%20SPAM&f=false) in newspaper advertisements what dishes Spam could be used for (for example, for spam cakes, pancakes, with pieces of fried pork), and even published a recipe book in 1940. By this time, Spam was already [purchased](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/spam-sales-break-record-hormel-foods-corp.html) by 70% of urban residents in the United States.

However, the real fame and international recognition came to Spam during the Second World War. Canned pork turned out to be an ideal food supply: high-calorie, high in protein, while being cheap and not requiring special storage conditions. During the war, American soldiers ate more than 150 million pounds (more than 68 thousand tons) of Spam. Every week, up to 15 million cans of the product were exported abroad. Canned food was eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and there were so many of them that new uses began to be found for them - for example, they lubricated firearms and boots to protect them from water.

As a result, Spam became not only an occasion for numerous jokes (Spam began to decipher as Special Purpose Army Meat - “special purpose army meat”), but also an object of real hatred in the American troops, since everyone was terribly tired of canned food. Jay Hormel received thousands of letters from the army, where he was both thanked and cursed. Soldiers wrote that "Spam is pork that didn't pass the physical" and called the product "the real reason the war was hell." “If they think Spam is so terrible, then let them eat corned beef, like in the last war,” the entrepreneur and veteran of the First World War indignant in an interview with the New Yorker magazine in 1945 in 1945. Be that as it may, it was then that Spam became a real cultural phenomenon.

At the same time, the product was also known abroad. As humanitarian aid, the United States supplied canned food to the UK and the USSR. “There were a lot of jokes, including indecent ones, about American stew. And yet it was delicious. There were many jokes about this, but we ate stew. Without it, it would be very difficult for us to feed the army, ”recalled Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev in his memoirs.

The distribution route of Spam coincided with the routes of the American army. The product was loved in countries and regions where the US military bases were located: in Japan, in the Philippines. After the Korean War of 1950–1953, Spam became popular in South Korea as well. There, American canned food is added to many national dishes and given as gifts for the Lunar New Year. Currently, South Korea is second only to the United States in terms of Spam consumption.

However, the product has taken a special place in Hawaiian culture. The reason was not only that there was a military base on the Hawaiian Islands. About 35% of Hawaii's population by the early 1940s were Japanese immigrants and their descendants, who also owned most of the region's fisheries. Many learned the craft in their historical homeland. As a result, before the start of World War II, when tensions between the United States and Japan intensified, the American authorities, who feared espionage, imposed sanctions against Japanese Hawaiians, [limiting](https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/637/JL35021.pdf?sequence=2) opportunities for fishing. After the attack on Pearl Harbor and the start of the war, fishing on the high seas was completely banned. The economy of Hawaii was seriously affected, and the locals were left without the main product in their diet - fish. And it was replaced by cheap and nutritious Spam.

Canned food took root, and since then, Hawaiian cuisine has been unimaginable without them. Every year Hawaiians consume about 7 million cans of Spam. Breakfasts with her are served in Hawaiian McDonald's restaurants. For a snack, a local resident is likely to choose spam musubi: a fried piece of Spam is placed on rice and wrapped in a sheet of nori in the manner of Japanese onigiri. “You can't open a Hawaiian restaurant without Spam on the menu. Spam is Hawaii. Hawaii is Spam,” said [Kistalin](https://gothamist.com/food/spam-is-making-a-comeback-at-hip-nyc-restaurants) Costa, a native of Hawaii and the owner of the New York restaurant Onomea.

Spam was taking over the world, but in the mainland states, attitudes towards the product weren't changing for the better. The soldiers who returned from the war could no longer see canned food, and this seriously frightened Jay Hormel. “He feared that Spam would continue to be a wartime phenomenon,” said Carolyn Wyman, author of Spam: A Biography. “It was a huge PR nightmare.” Hormel Foods saved the day with a marketing strategy that was eccentric for its time. The company formed a band of 60 female war veterans that traveled the country in 35 white Chevrolets. The girls performed at various events and concerts, went around houses and advertised Spam. Later, they even got their own radio show, which was the fourth most popular radio show in the US in 1953, [according](https://www.businessinsider.com/spam-makers-hormel-foods-worked-on-reputation-2020-3) to Nielsen.

In the 1950s, the number of working American women skyrocketed, and for them, Spam was an easy and quick way to feed their families. But already in the 1960s, attitudes towards the product began to change. The well-being of the population grew, and Spam reminded many of the times of poor childhood and youth. It has ceased to be a main dish, it is increasingly used as an addition to a sandwich or scrambled eggs for breakfast. Canned food was also stored in reserve, in case food ran out at home, or to take with you on the road. Thus, Spam, despite its status as a low-quality, cheap product, was still in use.

From Spam to Spam
-----------------

In post-war Great Britain, Spam also came into use, but by the end of the 1960s it had already managed to get fed up with everything. So much so that she became the heroine of a television [sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bW4vEo1F4E&ab_channel=GomesProClubs)comic group "Monty Python", shown in 1970. In the story, a husband and wife want to order breakfast at a cafe, but discover that there is not a single dish on the menu without Spam, although the visitor hates these canned goods. “There is Spam with egg, Spam with bacon and Spam,” the waitress calls the positions. At the end, the Vikings, who had breakfast in the same cafe, perform a laudatory ode to the product. In total, its name sounds 108 times during the video. The joke was enthusiastically picked up by both British and American viewers, and Spam has become synonymous with the word "meddlesome". However, the company did not protest against the extra attention. But then it was even impossible to imagine what consequences await the brand.

{{< img src="FO1SUTs.jpg" width="900" height="600" caption="Photo: Ethan Miller / Getty Images" >}}

The problems began in the mid-1980s, when, along with the spread of the Internet, intrusive advertising mailings appeared. Users, without thinking twice, compared the phenomenon with the famous sketch, and Spam overnight turned into a well-known email spam. Hormel Foods tried its best to get rid of such associations and endless jokes. The company's head of communications, Brian Olson, later noted that the firm "focused on protecting the brand from competitors and demonstrating how easy it was to use Spam to prepare different dishes." It got to the point that Hormel Foods sued the animation studio Jim Henson Productions, which produced cartoons about the Muppets: in one of them, a negative character was called Spam. The retailer lost the case and decided to act according to the principle “you can’t win, lead.”

“I think our shameful decision was to sue the creators of the Muppets. <...> It seems to me that this was a turning point, after which we decided that it was time to laugh with everyone, ”Jeff Ettinger, CEO of Hormel Foods, later recalled. And in fact, the brand seems to have stopped taking itself seriously. In 2001, a whole Spam Museum appeared in Austin, home to Hormel Foods, with a separate exposition dedicated to Monty Python. Three years later, the members of the British comedy group staged the musical Spamalot on Broadway (a play on words, a combination of Spam and Camelot.) based on the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Hormel Foods supported the premiere by releasing a limited edition of Spam featuring the characters on the packaging. A few years later, the brand introduced its first "ambassador" - a cartoon character named Sir Canalot (eng. Sir Can-A-Lot), who appeared both in advertising clips and on Spam social networks. In addition, to stir up the interest of the audience, the company began to release new varieties of the product, such as the low-calorie Spam and pumpkin-flavored Spam, now there are about 16 of them. The brand's website also contains a list of American restaurants that serve dishes with Spam. All these techniques help to find a common language with young buyers. In their commercials showing different ways to use canned food, Spam often relies on wordplay, a technique reminiscent of a 1940s product ad. This campaign was launched during the Super Bowl, the premier sporting event in the United States.

Indeed, continuity, relying on the nostalgic feelings of buyers, is an important element of Spam's marketing strategy. The recipe for the classic version has not changed much in 85 years (only in 2009 they began to add potato starch to improve the appearance of the meat), the packaging design remains practically the same as in 1937: a dark blue jar with rounded edges and a yellow logo . “We are true to our iconography. This is the product people want,” [explains](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/spam-sales-break-record-hormel-foods-corp.html) Hormel Foods Senior Brand Manager Brian Lillis.

Competent marketing allowed the brand not only to maintain its position in the market, but also to increase sales: in December 2021, Hormel Foods [reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/09/spam-sales-hit-record-high-for-seventh-straight-year-in-2021-says-hormel-foods-ceo.html) that Spam sales reached record levels for the seventh year in a row. The pandemic, therefore, has become only an additional sales driver. The company did not disclose figures for individual brands, Hormel Foods' total net sales [rose](https://investor.hormelfoods.com/news-events/press-releases/news-details/2021/Hormel-Foods-Reports-Record-Fourth-Quarter-Sales-And-Earnings-With-Double-Digit-Sales-Growth-From-Every-Segment/default.aspx) in 2021 by 19% year-on-year, to $11.4 billion. The same indicator for the grocery division increased by 56%, profit - by 36%. Analysts note brand awareness and the ability to painlessly increase the retail price of the product. Potential for growth in foreign markets: Spam is now available in 44 countries, Hormel Foods has high hopes for China, where it has been present since 2017. The company itself notes that sales in the US are growing partly due to migrants from Asia and Latin America. “These are the fastest growing consumer groups in the US,” says Lillis.

Hormel Foods claims that the brand's audience is not demographically biased, although this would not be surprising given the desire of millennials and zoomers to eat healthy and reduce the amount of meat in the diet. “We see changes in consumption dynamics. You might think that only those who want to save money and the older generation buy Spam, but this is not the case. We notice that the product is interesting to people of all ages,” explained the current CEO of Hormel Foods, Jim Snee. He now worries about the same problems as other American companies: rising staff costs, disruptions in supply chains and inflation. However, this is unlikely to affect Spam, which in 2019 occupied 90% of the American canned meat market. By 2023 Hormel Foods, inspired by the successes of recent years, plans to expand the brand's product line. And if one day the Monty Python sketch becomes a reality, then it will hardly come as a surprise to anyone.
