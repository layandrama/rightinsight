Fashion for unattractive things is firmly rooted in modern society. It is enough to look into the Brooklyn bar Doris and pay attention to the shoes of visitors. A mustachioed man in a 1980s neon jacket and open-toed sandals sits by candlelight in the bar's patio. Another guy, while waiting for a friend, adjusts his clogs. The bartender at Doris is a 24-year-old girl who introduces herself as Shivs. She is studying to be a tattoo artist, she has dark hair and platinum bangs bleached to the color of platinum. Shivs says customers like "ugly" shoes. In the summer they wear colorful Tevas, Birkenstock sandals and Crocs on the platform, while in winter they prefer discreet shoes insulated with sheepskin and fur. “It feels like ugly things always end up in fashion,” says Shivs.

"Ugly fashion" (uglycore) is not new. People have been flaunting not the most attractive things for years. But in the past two years, the unabashed love for practical shoes has intensified - people are tired of cramming into heels, pumps, loafers, brogues, oxfords or ballet flats. Odd-cut shoes were once reserved for surfers, walkers, and people prone to foot problems. And now they wear it to working meetings in Zoom, they show off in it on the catwalks of fashion shows and at parties.

The ability to create the most disgusting shoes has become almost a competitive advantage. Adidas' Yeezy Foam Runners, which look like perforated marshmallows and cost $80, are selling with a bang. Fluffy Koolaburra slippers wrap your feet in tiny faux fur blankets.

The new boots from Converse look like a hybrid of sneakers and rain boots, and look like someone has dipped Chuck Taylors high tops in rubber. For some reason, Balenciaga has attached high heels to Crocs clogs. “Fashion, like art, raises questions about beauty rather than just aiming for aesthetically pleasing design. If fashion is an art, then ugly is good too,” says Carolyn Mair, author of The Psychology of Fashion.

This cultural phenomenon plays into the hands of manufacturers of "ugly" shoes. The share price of the American Crocs in 2021 soared to a record high. The company predicts revenue will double to $5 billion over the next four years. In April 2021, L Catterton, a private equity firm backed by the world's largest luxury goods company LVMH, bought Birkenstock, a German orthopedic shoe maker. As part of the deal, Birkenstock was valued at approximately $4.9 billion.

The third, less well-known player in this market also does not waste time. Deckers Outdoor has quietly built a multi-billion dollar ugly shoe empire over the past 49 years. The key trademark of the company is UGG. Under this brand, Deckers produces popular uggs (sheepskin boots) worn by everyone from Long Island moms to seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady. Deckers also helped revive the Teva brand. Retailers Nordstrom and Anthropologie are promoting the firm's sandals, which are reminiscent of 1980s school shoes. More recently, Koolaburra (also owned by Deckers) has launched chunky fluffy peep-toe sandals, while Sanuk offers super-functional hemp moccasins.

But none of these brands can surpass Deckers' latest hit, the Hoka running shoe. They look like dad shoes, but they feel like Nike. Hoka is now Deckers' fastest growing business, with revenue up 47% year-on-year in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021/22 (quarter ended September 30).

The company forecasts that its revenue will exceed $3 billion in the current financial year (ends March 31), and sales of all brands will grow. Now Deckers has a product line that dominates the world of ugly shoes.

Deckers looks more like a luxury fashion house than casual clogs and sneakers, Easy Spirit, with its approach to comfortable footwear. The company believes that the product can be either bold or harmless. Deckers made their choice. Half measures would not allow the brand to gain popularity.

There are more shoes than people at Deckers' headquarters in the quiet Southern California beach town of Goleta. There are also quirky calf-high suede uggs, faux leather Teva sneakers with fold-over heels, a whole wall of colorful Hoka sneakers that look like a psychedelic work of art. Deckers CEO Dave Powers (he has held this post for the past six years) in the company's design studio shows an uggs wedge, the bottom of which is wrapped in brown jute. He picks up a blank from the shelf and examines it disapprovingly. Soon the sample will become one of countless models that will never hit the market. According to Powers, these ugg boots are too similar to regular shoes. He means they are too beautiful.

The Powers team seems to be taking the word "ugly" lightly. Hoka President Wendy Young is not offended when a [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/) journalist describes the company's products with this adjective. The leader is of the opinion that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder". According to Andrea O'Donnell, former top manager of the Ugg brand, designers do not intentionally make unattractive shoes. "We're focused on simplicity and precision in getting things done," says O'Donnell, who recently left the company. She headed the clothing company Everlane.

But Powers, dressed in a baseball cap and blue and white Hoka sneakers, says the company can't afford to be boring. Every Deckers brand has basic hits, but season after season designers are allowed to let their imagination run wild and experiment. Part of each collection is devoted to the search for a new breakthrough product. The company has 145 stores, and one of them is being used as a pilot. It tests how new products are sold. Thus, retailers can only sell those unusual shoes that are popular. “I don’t mind the word ‘ugly’. Basically it means that you are different from others. You own something special. It's a little unusual, but there's something interesting about it," Powers said.

The first Deckers shoe was no less interesting: striped flip flops. Company co-founders Doug Otto and Carl Lopker began selling them in the early 1970s in Santa Barbara, California. They were bought mainly by surfers who needed brighter beach sandals. But even then, the company noticed the first signs of a trend for "ugly" shoes. All over the country, hippies were in awe of the clumsy cork-soled sandals made by the German company Birkenstocks. This firm was founded by a shoemaker from Germany in 1774. After 200 years, the first Birkenstock sandals somehow became popular among American weed smokers in some strange way. At the same time, the shoes looked like they were created for training the calf muscles: the wearers had to pinch the insole with their toes so that it would not fall out.

By the early 1980s, Deckers executives became aware of the trendy Teva sandals. These shoes were invented by a guide who led tours of the Grand Canyon. He attached a watch strap to his slippers. A few years later, Deckers licensed the Teva brand. The company began to produce and sell sandals, which were in great demand. In 1995, the US Olympic team showed up to the Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway wearing ugg boots. Then Deckers acquired the Ugg brand for less than $15 million. However, ugg boots were not very popular until they hit the list of Oprah Winfrey's favorite things in 2000. Then the demand for these shoes soared, they began to wear them even in Hollywood. In 2002, when the licensing agreement with Teva expired, Deckers decided to invest in the sandal brand, buying it from the founder for $62 million.

This coincided in time with the entry of a new player into the fast-growing market for strange shoes. We are talking about the company Crocs, which quickly took an important place. At the Florida Boat Show, Crocs unveiled a foam resin clog. And suddenly, what used to be considered clumsy was considered incredibly fashionable. By 2012, British fashion designer Phoebe Philo created her own Birkenstock sandals trimmed with mink fur to show her Celine collection. Italian designer Giambattista Valli followed suit with a studded version of the Birkenstock, while Givenchy came up with double strap sandals. Marc Jacobs and Prada introduced Teva-inspired shoes in 2014. It was a combination of high fashion and roughness.

During this period, Deckers began to build up its presence in the ugly shoe niche. The company bought half a dozen brands. Although Sanuk, Hoka and Koolaburra had good prospects, it was clear that the firm had gone too far. “We had several influential brands. The rest were not destined to become like that, ”says Powers.

When Powers took over as CEO of Deckers, the firm was in trouble. She opened too many stores, acquired too many brands, misallocated inventory, and struggled to find new customers. Executives were reluctant to promote the Ugg brand, which until recently was a "cash cow", and sales stopped growing. By 2017, Deckers was spending more than they were making. “It was tough,” recalls Powers, who previously worked at Converse, Timberland and Gap.

Activist investors demanded a sale or merger of the company, as well as a revision of the composition of the board of directors. They accused Deckers management of "chronic inefficiency". Powers developed a fairly standard three-year business recovery strategy. It involved the consolidation of activities, the sale of weak brands and the closure of inefficient stores.

Then Deckers took one step that was both a desperate attempt to grab attention and a brilliant marketing ploy. The company crossed ugg boots with Teva sandals and received two new models. This shoe was immediately dubbed "the most disgusting." In particular, Deckers created boots with open sides and toe and sandals with lambswool lining on the upper part of the shoe. Nobody could understand why they were needed. They have holes in them so they are not meant for cold weather. And the sandals are sheepskin, which means you can’t wear them in the summer. So why were they created at all? Powers admits that they made them on purpose. “These shoes were uglier than I thought, but Deckers needed to get noticed. It was an attempt to shake things up,” he says. A flurry of media reports followed, including a headline in Cosmopolitan magazine:

The Ugg brand especially benefits from the company's experimentation with strategy. Designers take the basic model of uggs, and then change it in any way. In 2018, Ugg designers presented the Fluff Yeah model to top managers of the company - soft open-toed sandals trimmed with fur, with a thick elastic strap on the heel. A small test batch of these shoes, which were sold in Los Angeles, was a success. Then Deckers released the Fluff Yeah line. These sandals are now sold at Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's along with expensive brands like Stuart Weitzman and Tory Burch. In 2021, when clogs were in fashion, Ugg designers came up with a new version of the model, exaggerating its proportions. The first development was a platform clog with a wide band around the ankle and a huge amount of foam (“monster,” as Ugg designer Helen Frain calls it). This model looked too ugly even for Ugg manufacturers. Then in the fall of 2021, Tazz sleepers debuted on the market. They quickly sold out in high-end stores. The Tazz has been worn by celebrities like Gigi Hadid and videos of the shoe have gone viral on TikTok.

Hoka sneakers have proven to be a successful brand in the ugly shoe market. Designed by a French sneaker specialist and a professional runner. That designer now runs the Deckers Experimental Lab. The result of their joint work was a shoe with a bulky shock-absorbing sole. It has gained incredible popularity in the highly competitive sporting goods market dominated by Nike and Adidas. The arrival of the Hoka in 2018 coincided with a craze for oversized designer Balenciaga Triple S sneakers. The $1,000 price tag on the shoe hasn’t stopped it from capturing the hearts of fashionistas from Paris to Tokyo. Deckers didn't try to make cartoonish Hoka shoes prettier. On the contrary, the company took this iconic brand that attracted runners, and began to advertise it as "anti-fashion" sports shoes for men and women. In 2021, the Hoka brand overtook Ugg in sales and became a key source of revenue for Deckers. It continues to win market share from Nike.

Every shoe brand that has come before Hoka knows that even "ugly" shoes inevitably go out of style. This has already happened with Toms and Dr. Martens. Therefore, Deckers is working to ensure that the business has a long life. Teva, which saw a 66% increase in sales last summer, is trying to keep its style fresh. Recently, Teva introduced a new trend - sandals worn over socks. This image is popular with older European tourists. “If you take the original Teva sandals, the original Ugg boots, the original Hoka, they are all ugly. Really ugly,” says Powers.
