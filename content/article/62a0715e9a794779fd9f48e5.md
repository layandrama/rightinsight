WeWork created co-working spaces that it touted as the perfect place for freelancers to work. In ten years of operation, WeWork has become the largest private office tenant in 32 countries and a valuation higher than Serbia's GDP.

However, everything was reset even faster after the failed WeWork IPO. Much of the blame for this lies with the founder of the company, Adam Neumann, who preferred luxury to the development of the company, and instead of a sustainable business model, he built a sect based on the cult of his personality. After the scandal, he was fired, but as a result, he still became a billionaire.

We tell how Adam Neumann managed to deceive investors and his own employees, and then get away with it.

## Billion dollar idea

WeWork started out as a company that provided workspaces for technology startups. The target audience was millennials who lost their jobs during the 2008 crisis.

Even before the company was actually in operation, Neumann was talking to friends about how WeWork would be worth $500 million, or even $1 billion. Listeners found the vision intoxicating, and they followed the leader, willing to even spend the night at work to grow the company.

The concept for the business was that WeWork would rent space in the building and then divide the space into small offices and individual workspaces that entrepreneurs and small businesses would rent.

Monetization had to be different from the standard. Instead of partnering with a landlord and sharing the profits, the WeWork founders decided to simply rent an office, just like any other company does. The model was fraught with great risks: if the tenants never showed up, WeWork would still have to pay the rent. At the same time, this approach could bring huge profits, because the property owner would not be able to charge anything in excess of the agreed fee.

First, Neumann and his business partner, Miguel McKelvey, rented a building in Brooklyn in a terrible state that needed to be restored. Without waiting for the official opening of the first office, they began to look for new ones. It was a bold move - at that time they barely had enough money to complete the renovation in the first facility.

Then Neumann and McKelvey met Joel Schreiber. A day after the first meeting, Schreiber offered to invest in WeWork. Despite the fact that at that time they did not have a single paying client, Neumann and McKelvey said that the company was valued at $45 million. Schreiber did not bargain and agreed to invest $15 million in exchange for a third of the company. So, McKelvey and Neumann, with only an idea and not yet working offices, created a business worth $45 million.

According to Neumann's plan, the company was to expand rapidly. However, this required money, and Schreiber was in no hurry to transfer his share. By 2011, just a year after WeWork opened, the company was already facing a cash crunch. At some point, in order to cover salaries and other expenses, the partners even took out a loan from a friend in the amount of $150,000, regardless of the high interest rate.

To finally solve the financial problems, Neumann decided to look for money in Silicon Valley.

## A charismatic leader is the key to success

Neumann said that WeWork is not a real estate business. Clients came for the community, he said, not just for the desktop. In the same way that companies pay for bookkeeping outsourcing, here they paid for office outsourcing.

Much of the success lay in the atmosphere of the WeWork offices: music blared in the lobby and coffee shops packed with twenty-somethings dressed in jeans and sneakers. The office was more like a trendy bar or cafe, full of ideas and conversations floating around.

Neumann believed that WeWork should be valued at more than $100 million, and he managed to attract three investors who agreed with this. So the company received $17 million for expansion. Neumann and McKelvey, meanwhile, allocated $500,000 each for personal expenses.

To attract new and new investors, Neumann conducted tours of the offices. On days like these, employees had to “activate the space”—to show that WeWork facilities are full of life and energy, which is in stark contrast to the sterile, boring offices of the past. If there were empty tables on the floor during the tour, company employees were asked to fill them up to make it appear that the floor was occupied by hard-working members of the WeWork community, regardless of the time of day. Even a special playlist of funny but unobtrusive songs was included. In addition, an employee working at the front desk had to throw an impromptu party with pizza, ice cream or cocktails.

Delighted by this show, Neumann took investors to his office, where he explained the essence of the business and the inevitability of its rapid growth. Even in the morning he offered to drink expensive Don Julio tequila. In conversation, Neumann mentioned actors and mayors he knew to make an additional impression. All this was not like the usual meetings to discuss real estate investments.

Neumann said that WeWork is the same platform as Facebook or LinkedIn, on which the company could place, for example, also accounting services, thereby increasing the average check.

In fact, WeWork technologies could hardly be called cutting-edge. The company struggled unsuccessfully to create a basic billing system and a "killer" app. But investors did not get hung up on the details. The presentation was too persuasive.

Inspired by the tour, SoftBank President and CEO Masayoshi offered the company $4 billion in 2016, one of the largest ever for a startup.

However, not all the millions raised went to the development of the company. Some went into Neumann's bank account. In particular, the company provided a $9 million loan to We Holdings LLC, which owned Neumann and McKelvey's shares in WeWork. By then, McKelvey's stake had dropped to 15%, so Neumann got the bulk of the money, hoping to repay the loan as WeWork's value rose.

This was just one of the cases in which Neumann spent the company's money on himself. Ultimately, this was the only way he began to finance his own lifestyle. Neumann even bought himself a plane for $60 million. Almost two meters tall, the WeWork founder did not feel well in the seats of ordinary airliners. In addition, it was possible to smoke marijuana in a personal jet. According to eyewitnesses, the pilots had to fly the plane in oxygen masks - there was so much smoke in the cabin.

## Employees were also influenced by Neumann

The corporate culture of the company strongly resembled a sect. Neumann not only required employees to work overtime, but also determined how they would eat. For example, WeWork banned the consumption of meat, which was dictated by environmental concerns on the part of Neumann and his wife. These noble initiatives did not concern the founder himself - shortly after the introduction of the meat ban, Neumann was noticed eating lamb chop at WeWork headquarters. The paperless policy, which was never adopted, would also not apply to Neumann, who simply did not use a computer.

In addition to daily motivational “fly-ups”, employees had to attend an annual team building camp. Moreover, they could be fired for refusing to participate, as well as for leaving the event before it ended.

The company did not skimp on entertainment in the camp: there were rowing, yoga, martial arts, football, parachuting. Employees could pet ponies, learn how to make pottery or dye T-shirts. Alcohol and marijuana were constantly available.

The nightlife was even crazier. Pop singer Lorde, indie pop band Bastille, Swedish DJ Alesso and even The Weeknd performed for WeWork employees.

Many people like to work this way. The co-founder of the Flatiron School, which WeWork bought in 2017, even got a We tattooed on him. While at the camp, a community manager proposed to his girlfriend in front of a cheering crowd of colleagues. Neumann encouraged coupled employees to get “WeKids,” offering them free education at WeWork schools that the company intended to open.

During team building events, almost all employees lived in shared tents and used bathrooms and toilets, which regularly broke down. According to one of the employees, she woke up when she heard someone urinate on the wall of her tent. "I'm not here to be pissed off," she told reporters.

For all the talk of We (that is, “us”), universal equality and egalitarianism, the CEO and his family were still in a special position. For Neumann, his wife and five children, a whole mini-complex of luxury trailers was built at the camp. The list of products for the Neumann complex alone was simply amazing: it included, among other things, 12 cases of Don Julio 1942 and two bottles of Highland Park whiskey, which were sold at a price of more than $ 1,000. The founder's family also needed two bartenders, a Range Rover and a Mercedes V-class.

## Bubble burst

In 2019, SoftBank invested another $2 billion in WeWork, and the company's total valuation reached $47 billion. However, the bank was not ready to give more than the $10 billion already invested by that time.

WeWork had no choice but to go public. In connection with the prospect of an IPO, WeWork had to disclose financial statements. When the paper was published, the WeWork illusion began to dissipate almost immediately. Commentators even ridiculed the language in which the report was written. The phrase about “we energy”, which was “inside each of us”, especially got it. What sounded good on pitchings, on paper, could no longer deceive anyone.

The numbers showed what many skeptics suspected. So, in the first six months of 2019 alone, WeWork spent $1.37 billion. According to the report, the company brought only losses - about $3 thousand per minute. Worse, the report showed that Neumann even cashed in on the word We: he sold the rights to use the word to his own company for about $5 million. The report also showed that the founder had stakes in real estate the company rented.

The response was swift and harsh. The value of WeWork plummeted, an IPO was out of the question.

Eventually, Neumann was forced to leave his own company. However, he didn't stay put. After selling shares in SoftBank, he could [receive](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/business/adam-neumann-wework-exit-package.html) at least $1 billion, he was also paid for consulting services in the amount of $185 million. According [to the](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-co-founder-adam-neumann-is-becoming-an-apartment-mogul-11641292207) WSJ, he continues to engage in real estate in the United States.
