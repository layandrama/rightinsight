Wang stumbled upon the idea that made him rich while studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It occurred to the student to make his refrigerator “smart”: he installed a video camera on one of its shelves and sat down to write a program that would tell what products it was time to go to the store. It soon became clear that the task was much more difficult than it seemed. For example, in order for the algorithm to distinguish oranges from lemons, it was necessary to train it on a set of photos of these fruits from different angles. There was no standardized and public image database where some fruits were labeled as oranges and others as lemons existed.

Wang began to study the problem - and realized that it hinders the development of thousands of companies: even many large enterprises could not train artificial intelligence due to the lack of databases with the necessary data labeling. These bases were created only inside giants like Google and Amazon and were guarded by them more than an eye. Wang decided to steal the fire from powerful corporations - to make their technology publicly available.

Data is the new code
--------------------

During his school years, Alexander Wang participated in competitions in mathematics and programming. At the age of 17, he already [worked as](https://www.forbes.com/sites/colehorton/2022/05/25/the-new-youngest-self-made-billionaire-in-the-world-is-a-25-year-old-college-dropout/?sh=534b5be6494b) a programmer on the Quora site, where users can ask questions and get answers on various topics, and then went to study machine learning at MIT. The situation at the world's leading technological institute surprised him. According to the entrepreneur, students who studied mechanical engineering [made](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/scale-ai-machine-learning-startup-alexandr-wang/) catapults on lawns. Those who specialized in the design of electrical devices are robots. And those who were involved in computer science developed applications for their friends. “But no one did anything related to AI,” Wang was surprised: after all, all these future specialists studied artificial intelligence and understood that it was the most promising technology in existence.

When Wang delved into the subject, he discovered that the problem was not just that programmers did not have access to the right information. It still needed to be processed so that it could be used in machine learning. Standardized data labeling tools simply did not exist. “I saw a lot of potential in AI and machine learning and was excited about how it could change the world,” the entrepreneur recalls. “But the real effect of all this has not yet been.”

And in the summer of 2016, after completing his first year, nineteen-year-old Wang and Lucy Guo, whom he met while working at Quora, founded Scale AI. The idea was to create a data labeling platform that any company could use. The peculiarity of the market, Wang noted, was that large IT companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon developed the necessary technologies in-house and for themselves. “They have many teams, resources and deep expertise,” explains the entrepreneur. IT giants considered these technologies as their advantage and were not going to share them with anyone.

There were also companies that dealt with certain aspects of the problem of working with data. However, they did not have enough resources to solve. And it was impossible to build a good AI algorithm on poorly processed data. For example, a chatbot created on the basis of scarce information could not maintain a full-fledged conversation and answer most of the questions that the user was interested in. The problem, according to Wang, was so serious that if the work with data did not reach a new level, AI would be destined to remain a highly specialized technology. Big data, Wang realized, was becoming the "new code" from which programs were built. Scale AI intended to develop and offer to a wide market technologies that giants create only for themselves, and in a standardized version.

The youngest billionaire
------------------------

Scale AI received its first investment of $120,000 in 2016 from the well-known business incubator Y Combinator. The money was small, but allowed the company to survive until next year, when it managed to [raise](https://scale.com/blog/announcing-our-series-a-with-accel) an already quite serious $ 4.5 million from several investors, including venture capital company Accel. With these funds, Scale AI began to actively hire employees. In 2018, another $18 million was invested in the company. And the real success came in 2019, when the startup raised $100 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion. Wang, who was only 22 years old, [became a](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/scale-ai-and-its-22-year-old-ceo-lock-down-100-million-to-help-label-silicon-valleys-data/) “unicorn”.

By that time, Scale AI had about a hundred permanent employees and about 30 thousand people who helped mark up data - text, audio, images, video. Much of this process is done by hand. Even then, among the company's customers were Waymo, a technology maker for unmanned vehicles, taxi aggregator Lyft, and Airbnb. According to billionaire Peter Thiel, a partner at Founders Fund, a venture capital firm that also invested in Scale AI, Wang's venture was building key infrastructure for the market's most important players. With this, Thiel explained his belief in the prospects of a startup.

Thiel was right: in 2020, Scale AI raised another $155 million. And this was not the limit. In 2021, $325 million was [invested](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-scale-ai-funding-idUSKBN2C02QN) in the company at a valuation of $7 billion. According to Forbes, 24-year-old Wang then owned 15% of the company, making him the youngest self-made billionaire. Since the creation of his startup, as Wang notes, the scope of AI has only grown, in particular, the technologies of unmanned vehicles, natural language processing or the search for new drugs using AI, and others have developed. Back in 2015, Wang recalls, only big tech companies could really use AI. Today, on the basis of AI, a variety of businesses create products.

As the reasons for success in Scale AI , they [cite](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/5-alternatives-to-scale-ai) the fact that at the time the company appeared on the market, it did not have serious competitors who would be engaged in data labeling for machine learning. However, as often happens, family ties also helped. Wang's parents are physicists working for American military programs at the famous Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and it was from the US Department of Defense that their son's company received contracts for a considerable amount, even by American standards, of $ 350 million, and this is at a minimum estimates. Not surprisingly, Scale AI enjoys the confidence of investors, having contracts for such amounts from such a customer.

The global market for data markup for machine learning, according [to](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/data-annotation-tools-market)experts, in 2030 will exceed $5.3 billion compared to $805.6 million in 2022. Demand is fueled by the spread of information about the technology, as well as improved data labeling efficiency due to new investments in this area. So far, the bulk of the data is marked manually, despite the development of automation. This is due to the higher accuracy that manual work gives. In addition, human markers can discover patterns in data streams that can be integrated into an algorithm. But this is an expensive way of processing data, which also requires a longer time. Therefore, automatic labeling tools are expected to continue to evolve. Semi-automatic marking methods are also used now, in which a person performs only a controlling function.

More than internet
------------------

The company is expected to break even by 2021. From a business standpoint, Scale AI hasn't gone the way AI companies usually go, which is trying to build the best possible product without worrying about making a profit, Wang said. As the entrepreneur says, Scale AI, in contrast, was built on the basis of partnerships with companies that were helped to create their own AI algorithms. Wang proceeded from the fact that Scale AI should become the basis of the ecosystem. It is this approach, he is sure, that allowed his company to develop sustainably.

As an example, Wang cites his collaboration with States Title, also founded in 2016 and dedicated to accelerating the process of real estate transactions using information technology. Wang's company is helping States Title create algorithms that automate document processing. This allowed Scale AI to grow along with States Title, whose revenue approached $200 million in 2019.

The Scale AI strategy is precisely to work with companies from industries in which the use of AI is most promising: they will grow and, accordingly, Scale AI will grow with them. Therefore, Scale AI works with companies in the financial sector (PayPal), the automotive industry (Toyota, autonomous vehicle division), software (SAP), food tech (Instacart) and others. Scale AI's competitors, however, argue that the company's tools are more suitable for labeling data for self-driving cars and less so for other areas such as natural language processing, medical imaging and facial recognition. Be that as it may, Wang himself is full of optimism. He believes that by 2030, AI will change people's lives as much as the Internet once did, or even more.

**“Data by itself is worthless”**

_Alexey Borisov, Director of Acceleration in the direction of "Fuel and Energy Complex and Industry" of the Information Technology Cluster of the Skolkovo Foundation_

“In some areas, such as finance and telecom, there is enough data for machine learning, while someone does not have any at all. In general, in order to conduct machine learning, data is generated - that is, special algorithms create them specifically for training. There is also a separate market for data sets with both paid and free data. The market is quite promising. One of his problems is false datasets: they train AI incorrectly and have to be cleaned up.

There are a lot of industry associations in America that share data. In Russia, the market is just emerging. The Central Bank was the first to implement the idea of ​​data exchange, but this approach has not yet found wide support among banks, because free data has no value, everyone gets it anyway. By itself, the data is worth nothing, their markup, processing and enrichment are important. You need a context, without a context, the data will be empty. This is the only way to run machine learning algorithms.”
