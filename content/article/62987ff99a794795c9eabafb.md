Fellow students considered Said Arbab a mathematical and investment genius. At 21, he already had his own hedge fund, which brought him fame and fortune.

However, if Said was a genius, it was only in manipulating people. He was not prepared for the fact that the value of assets does not always grow, and often falls. Arbab lived on the fund's money, bought cars, used drugs and played in a casino. As a result, the hedge fund turned into a financial pyramid, the destruction of which buried the money of all Said's friends and acquaintances.

We tell how a financial genius turned into a criminal and what chats on social networks have to do with it.

Screenshots of a portfolio with hundreds of percent profits

Said's first success in investing was in high school. At least that's how he says it himself. Arbab noticed that many of the girls around him started wearing Lululemon leggings. Then Said suggested that his father buy shares in the company, and it turned out to be a good investment: the yield was 40%.

After high school, Said received a scholarship and went to study at the University of Georgia, wanting to follow in his father's footsteps and become a doctor. In order to make friends and get to the best parties, Said decided to join the student fraternity. The situation was complicated by the Arab origin of Arbab, which in the south of America was considered rather a disadvantage. Interest in finance helped solve this problem.

“I told the fraternity guys that I follow the market. Then the film “The Wolf of Wall Street” was just released, and I also wanted to get on Wall Street to live like Jordan Belfort,” Said himself tells about that time in the HBO documentary series [“Generation of Swindlers”](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11210524/) .

Arbab created a group in GroupMe and named it "Wolves of Broad Street" after the name of the street where the fraternity house was located. No financial transactions were carried out in this chat, but it was there that Said posted his profitable transactions. At the same time, Arbab traded not in shares, but in riskier options.

“He would post a screenshot and everyone would think, ‘He’s fumbling,’” recalls his college friend Will.

In his second year, Said decided to raise rates and bet $30,000, that is, all his money, on the rise in the price of gold after the increase in the key rate. The Fed meeting was watched by the entire fraternity. And hopes were justified - the rate was raised, the price of gold soared. Arbab had $112,000 on his account. Said earned not only money, but also the respect of his comrades - the Wolves of Broad Street group reached 12,000 people.

A hedge fund from a man who doesn't know what a hedge fund is

Soon, Said's followers began asking him to teach them how to trade, and some were willing to trust him with their own money. Arbab did not refuse: he received from them from $ 500 to $ 1 thousand, for which he made transactions.

The stakes quickly rose - people were ready to give him $10,000 each. Then Said decided to turn the community into a hedge fund, which he called Artis Proficio Capital Investments ("Professional Profit" in Latin).

“To be honest, back then I didn’t know what a hedge fund was. Of course, I heard this word, but I didn’t understand its meaning at all,” Said admits. “So I went online, googled ‘hedge fund contracts’ and took the contract from the internet as a basis.”

Said gave a guarantee of up to $15 thousand, that is, in case of failure, he promised to return this money from his own pocket. For students who invested a couple of thousand each, it sounded like a 100% guarantee of success.

Arbab invested all his money in the fund - about $120,000. The investments of the first clients amounted to about another $50,000. Then several business angels came and brought about $200,000. With this capital, the fund began to invest.

Said reported as simply as he took the money. Every week, investors received an Excel spreadsheet with all transactions. In it, they could find their account number and track the dynamics of the portfolio. Thus, Said showed clients that not only they earn, but everyone else. According to Arbab, the total return of the fund was about 25%.

Said himself did not live in poverty either: he got a Chevrolet Corvette, bought clothes and watches, traveled, used drugs, constantly uploaded photos and videos from parties.

“People see a student on a Corvette with beautiful girls and think: “But the guy knows how to make money.” It's free advertising. Success lures success,” Said explains his behavior.

The market crash led to ruin

In the fall of 2018, the market was at its peak. By that time, according to Said, he had about $700,000. “The money was flowing like a river,” he says. On the growth of securities, he managed to bring the balance to $1.1 million.

However, in December the market began to fall. The total amount of all hedge fund accounts fell from $1 million to $600,000.

“The losses were huge. Nobody wants to hear at Christmas: “You lost 40% of your portfolio. I'm sorry," Said says. However, in early January, the amount in the fund's accounts fell to $250,000.

Arbab decided to hide the losses. So when customers started asking where the table was, he sent them the version with the old numbers.

“I had two options. File for bankruptcy, but these are my friends and relatives. They trusted me with money. I didn't want to explain to them why it happened. I wanted to win back,” Arbab admits. To recoup the losses, he had to risk even more.

Saeed's friends were unaware of the losses, more concerned about Arbab's lack of an officially registered company, so they introduced him to hedge fund expert Steven Romanoff. Said also deceived him, saying that the fund still has a million under management. Steven agreed to help with the organization and paperwork, bringing brokers and lawyers to the team. However, this only increased the bills that Said had to pay.

All Arbab needed at that moment were new investors and their money.

Trying to save everything

Friends introduced Said to an investor who believed he could raise capital in just a couple of weeks. So Arbab received about $100,000, which he brought to the stock exchange and lost almost immediately.

To return the money, Said decided to go to Vegas and win the required amount. However, he lost almost everything that remained in the fund.

“There seemed to be no way out. I received 300 messages a day. The fund continued to lose money in the markets. I was trying to get $100,000 back to that investor and get it done as quickly as possible. I started selling cocaine,” says Said. There were rumors that he was the biggest drug dealer at the University of Georgia. However, Arbab still failed to earn $100,000 on time.

After Vegas, Romanoff began to actively monitor the reports. Then Said began to ask investors to transfer money through electronic wallets. However, it turned out that it was not he who received the transfer, not the “fintech manager”, as Said told his clients, but the very investor to whom Arbab owed $100,000.

According to the laws of the United States, a scheme in which the head of an organization uses the money of a second investor to pay off the first is called nothing more than a pyramid scheme. As soon as investors learned that it was not the fund that was receiving their e-wallet transfers, they turned to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investigation and trial

When the SEC launched its investigation, according to media reports, Said only had $350 left in his account. He even came to the meeting with representatives of the commission without a lawyer. According to acquaintances, Arbab did not take the investigation seriously and continued to post photos from parties.

During the trial, assistant prosecutor Lindy Freeman [said](https://www.onlineathens.com/story/news/crime/2020/09/25/former-uga-student-gets-5-years-in-prison-for-1-million-ponzi-scam/43056055/) that Arbab was a hard-core liar who continued to lie even when he knew he was under investigation. Authorities have proven that he spent the fund's money on clothes, restaurants, alcohol, adult entertainment and at least three trips to Las Vegas. He also gave false affidavits and lied about his cocaine use.

Several of Arbab's victims testified in court. One investor who lost $75,000 burst into tears and confessed to contemplating suicide.

“What he did to my life is unfair. And he doesn’t care,” the former investor said. “I can never forgive myself for falling into the trap.”

Another investor said that even after his arrest, Arbab continued to act like an idiot and there must be consequences.

“He doesn’t care that he took people’s hard-earned money,” said a third investor, adding that he thought the news of the arrest helped boost Saeed’s self-esteem and provided additional PR on social media.

In 2020, Saeed Arbab [was sentenced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/georgia-man-sentenced-prison-running-ponzi-scheme) to 60 months in prison for running a pyramid scheme that killed more than 100 people. The court also ordered Said to pay the investors $509,000 in compensation.

“This story is a reminder that investors of all ages and levels of experience, whether longtime investors or recent graduates investing from their first few paychecks, should carefully study investment opportunities and the people offering them,” [said](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7116865/UGA-student-ran-Ponzi-scheme-frat-house-defrauded-eight-people-269-000.html) the SEC Regional Director in Atlanta .
