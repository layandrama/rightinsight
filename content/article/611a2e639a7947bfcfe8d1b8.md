Walter Schloss was one of the most successful investors in history, but outside of the value investor community, few people know about him. Born in 1916, he began working on Wall Street at the age of 18, when the stock market was still recovering from the 1929 crash.

He started with the simplest work - he carried the orders of buyers and shares from the broker to the stock exchange and back. Thanks to the fact that the New York Stock Exchange in 1934 began to send its rank-and-file employees for advanced training, most of whom had no financial education, Schloss began to study with Benjamin Graham. And later he began to work in his investment company Graham Newman Partnership.

Walter Schloss was interested in Graham's statistical approach to investing. The methods of Benjamin Graham laid the foundation on which Schloss built his career, becoming a legend in value investing.

The closure in 1955 of the Graham Newman Partnership opened up opportunities for Graham's students to start their own businesses. Buffett organized his first company then. And Walter Schloss founded the Walter Schloss Associates (later Walter & Edwin Schloss Associates) fund, which successfully managed capital for 47 years. During this period, the fund returned an average of 16% per annum after paying commissions, while the S&P 500 index returned 10%.

The basis of Schloss's strategy was to buy cheap stocks with good financial performance and hold them until they rise in price. Schloss considered the P / B (P / BV) multiple (the ratio of capitalization to equity (book value) as the best indicator of the company's value), preferring to buy shares that traded below book value.

Warren Buffett considers Schloss one of the most prominent investors - he mentioned him in his famous essay The Super Investors of Graham-And-Doddsville. We analyze the rules of investing Walter Schloss.

Do not believe the words of the company's management

Schloss [warned](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms) that investors should not believe the promises made by the company's management, including in terms of earnings forecasts.

“I have nothing against profit forecasting, except that in practice its size can change. Also, even if your revenue projections are correct, people's perception of a fair multiple for a company may change. Therefore, it is much more comfortable and pleasant for me to focus on the book value. Earnings are much more likely to change than book value, and therefore forecasting earnings beyond a year or so could be a serious mistake,” he [said](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms) .

## Don't Let Emotions Influence Your Investment Decisions

Schloss [believed](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms) that weak emotional intelligence could ruin an investor's career. Because this quality will not allow a person to take a good opportunity and buy undervalued stocks. And it will be equally difficult for him to hold onto these stocks when they start to fall.

“The ability to think clearly without involving emotions in the investment process is not an easy task. As a rule, a person is ruled by fear and greed. You must have a strong will and be ready to accept unexpected losses, ”the investor [believed .](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms)

## Ignore Market Noise

According to Schloss, in order to [make](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms) more informed and correct investment decisions, investors must learn to step back from the daily information noise in the market. This will allow you to control your emotions and not make mistakes.

“The stock market is a place where emotions reign, including fear and greed, as well as other unpleasant qualities that people have. I try to stay away from market emotions,” [said](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms) Schloss.

## Invest only in what you are good at

Schloss [said](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms) that it is important for investors to invest only in areas that they understand better.

"If you're not comfortable with certain assets and don't even have a basic idea of ​​what you want to invest in, then you're probably better off learning more about the business or just looking for other stocks to invest in, " he [said](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms) .

## When to buy or sell shares

One of the biggest problems any value investor faces, according to Schloss, is not [knowing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms) when to sell a stock. It's not difficult to determine which stocks are currently cheap and which can outperform the market, but deciding when to sell them is not an easy task.

Schloss believed that if investors bought shares cheaply relative to their real value, and then held them long enough, then in the future such a company would definitely turn around and make a decent profit. He believed that if the price falls and the fundamentals remain stable, then this is a good time to buy even more of these shares.

“When you buy a company that is in a doldrums, its shares will not go up immediately after you bought it. On the contrary, they will fall. Therefore, you will have to wait a while, ”he [said](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms) .

Schloss has always [noted](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/15-tips-from-super-investor-walter-schloss-a-stock-investor-must-always-follow/articleshow/83256466.cms) the importance of a diversified portfolio, especially in the long run. He believed that one share should account for no more than 20% of the entire portfolio, and there could be up to 100 of them in the portfolio.

In 1994, Walter Schloss [laid out](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092915/walter-schloss-approach-investing.asp) his principles for making money in the stock market in 16 rules that can be helpful for newcomers to value investing.

## [16 success](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092915/walter-schloss-approach-investing.asp) factors in investing from Walter Schloss

1\. Price is the most important factor in determining the value of an asset.

2\. Try to determine the real value of the company. Remember that stocks are part of a business and not just a security.

3\. Use the book value as a starting point for determining the value of the company. Make sure the debt is not equal to 100% of her net worth.

4\. Be patient. Shares are rising gradually.

5\. When buying, do not listen to advice and do not focus on the short movement of quotes - this is more suitable for professionals. Don't sell on bad news.

6\. Don't be afraid to go it alone, but make sure you're right in your judgments. You can't be 100% sure, but try to find the weak spots in your thinking.

7\. Have the courage to stick to your beliefs after you make a specific decision.

8\. Develop your investment philosophy and try to follow it.

9\. Don't rush to sell. If a stock reaches a price you think is fair, you can sell it. But quite often, when a stock goes up, say, 50%, people advise to sell it to take profits. Before selling, try to re-evaluate the company again and see what the ratio of the sale price to the book value is. Be aware of the level of the stock market. Is the yield low and the P/E multiple high right now?

10\. I think it's right to buy near the lows of the last few years. A stock could go up to $125 and then drop to $60, and you'll think that's an attractive price. If a stock was trading at $20 three years earlier, this shows that there is some vulnerability in it.

11\. Try to buy assets at a discount, not on the basis of earnings data. Incomes can change dramatically in a short time. You need to know a lot about a company if you're buying on a profit basis.

12\. Listen to recommendations from people you respect. This does not mean that you should take their advice. Remember that this is your money and is generally harder to keep than to earn. If you lose a lot of money, it will be quite difficult to get it back.

13\. Try not to let your emotions influence your judgment. Fear and greed are probably the worst emotions that can arise when buying and selling stocks.

14\. Be mindful of compound interest. For example, if you earn 12% per year and reinvest that money back, then you will double your money in six years before taxes. Remember Rule 72. It tells you how many years it will take you to double your money. (By dividing 72 by the return on investment, you can get an estimate of the number of years it takes for the initial investment to double.)

15\. Prefer stocks over bonds. Bonds will limit your profits and inflation will reduce your purchasing power.

16\. Beware of buying on credit. This may work against you.
