title: "How Netflix overcame two severe crises and “ate” a strong competitor"
description: It’s hard to imagine now that Netflix was in the DVD rental business and weathered the 2000 dot-com crash and the 2008 global financial crisis. The recipe for success is tough financial discipline, readiness for radical change and a little bit of luck.

This year's Oscars promised to be a triumph for Netflix. "Power of the Dog" received a record 12 nominations, including Best Picture. In this category, the tape was considered the main favorite, but in the end the picture lost to "CODA: Child of Deaf Parents", a film produced by Apple TV +.

The struggle for supremacy in the "big cinema" is the next stage in the fierce competition of streaming services. Netflix has been the market leader for years, with $30 billion in revenue in 2021 and 221.8 million global users by March 2022. Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ are still nowhere near those numbers. However, the path to the position of the market leader was thorny: the company survived two severe crises, and it is not the first time that it can withstand competition with larger and more experienced corporations.

Cinema in an envelope
---------------------

In 1997, Reed Hastings sold his first software diagnostic startup, Pure Atria (formerly Pure Software), to Rational Software. Behind him was a service in the Peace Corps (a humanitarian organization that sends volunteers to distressed countries to provide assistance), a job as a math teacher and studying at Stanford. Now he, having a solid capital after the sale of the company, was looking for an idea for a new project. Hastings chose Mark Randolph as his partner. Once Pure Software bought his startup, after which he headed the marketing department of the company, and the entrepreneurs quickly found a common language.

Randolph later recalled that they did not have a moment of insight: the search was long and painful. Among the ideas were customized baseball bats and shampoos personalized for each customer. As a result, the entrepreneurs decided to create a website where it would be possible to rent films on DVD. Back then, the format was virtually unfamiliar in the US. “Until 1997, DVDs were only available in Japan. And even if you found one, you wouldn't be able to use it because DVD players weren't sold in the US yet,” Randolph said in his book It Won't Work. The story of Netflix as told by its founder. But it was clear that it was only a matter of time before videocassettes were abandoned in favor of more convenient discs. It was also much cheaper to mail a disc than a video cassette. Finally, existing video rental services (including the largest player in the segment, Blockbuster) simply annoyed customers with the need to go to the rental point, limited selection of films and high commissions if the tape was not returned on time. The latter even formed the basis of the legend about the creation of a company invented for journalists. Hastings said in early interviews that he forgot to return the Apollo 13 cassette in time and was forced to pay $40 (he later confirmed that this incident actually happened, but was not a starting point for entrepreneurs). The latter even formed the basis of the legend about the creation of a company invented for journalists. Hastings said in early interviews that he forgot to return the Apollo 13 cassette in time and was forced to pay $40 (he later confirmed that this incident actually happened, but was not a starting point for entrepreneurs).

It took about a year to prepare for the launch, and in the spring of 1998, the Netflix.com website went live. Renting one disc cost $4, another $2 had to be paid for postage. Hastings and Randolph understood that they did not have time to “build up”, since at any moment one of the large and experienced companies could pick up the idea. The offer to buy a startup, received from the founder of Amazon Jeff Bezos, was proof of this. To attract and retain an audience, Netflix.com offered discounts to those who ordered more than two discs at once, held customer raffles, and offered free three-disc rentals to buyers of Toshiba DVD players. Customers received discs in red envelopes, which soon became the company's "visiting card".

The company gradually improved its business model and customer service. In 1999, Netflix.com switched to subscription. The user paid $15.99 per month and could order four discs at once, with no set return period or late fees. But, only by returning the disk, the client could get the next one. The first month was generally free: new users could evaluate the service before making a decision. Later, the cost rose to $19.99. A year later, the site launched the Cinematch recommendation system - the algorithm created selections based on the ratings that users gave to films. Both innovations later played a decisive role in the success of the company.

Decadent Moods
--------------

The number of Netflix.com users has grown exponentially. In 2000, the service had nearly 200,000 US customers, 5,800 movies in the library, and more than 1 million discs in stock. The total volume of attracted investments was $100 million. Netflix.com filed for an IPO, and in order to win the favor of investors, it launched a portal with movie reviews and news from the world of cinema on its website. “At that time, it was believed that a successful site had to offer a person everything at once - if you wanted to get money, you needed good traffic,” Randolph wrote.

And then there was an event that went down in history as the “collapse of the dot-coms”: on March 10, 2000, the NASDAQ high-tech index reached a record high, and then collapsed sharply. Over the following months, it fell 70% from its March high. Many Internet companies have gone bankrupt, been sold or liquidated.

The IPO had to be postponed indefinitely. Randolph noted that this saved the company: if Netflix.com went public in the fall of 2000, then it would have to continue on the path of a rich Internet portal (which required a huge investment) and at the same time try to satisfy the inflated expectations of investors. Failure would be inevitable.

However, venture capital funds and business angels began to bypass the IT sector, and, unable to attract external funding, Netflix.com was left alone with the accumulated financial problems. If investors lost interest in it, then the popularity among users only grew, which means that the number of users in the trial period increased every month. The company took over the costs of their maintenance, so the costs grew rapidly. At the same time, the company charged money from other subscribers for a month, and not, for example, for a year, and as a result, there were simply not enough resources to cover ever-increasing costs. The only way out seemed to be selling the company to a more experienced and financially stable player. So Hastings and Randolph went to meet Blockbuster CEO John Antioco.

{{<ads>}}

Hastings went on to explain to Antioco that new formats like DVD were the future, and that buying Netflix.com would be a major competitive advantage for Blockbuster. And then he named the price for which he was ready to sell the company - $ 50 million. Antioko barely restrained his laughter and put the entrepreneurs out of the office. Later, this decision will be called one of the greatest business blunders in history, and Hastings will be glad that the deal did not take place. But at that moment, it became obvious that Netflix.com could not wait for help from anywhere else.

There was only one way out - to tighten the belts. “We didn't have to be profitable, but we needed to demonstrate that we were close to it before going public,” Randolph explained. “If we continued to take $40 million from investors and then report a loss of $45 million, then we would not have expected a good estimate.” The company stopped developing a portal with reviews and left only the main direction - rental. The service tested several subscription plans ranging from $9.95 to $24.95. The experiment was turned off, and for all users there was a single cost - $ 19.95. In addition, it was decided to remove ".com" from the name: what used to attract investors now scared them.

But Netflix's costs were still too high, and the company's management went to extreme measures - cuts. Hastings later recalled the days he, Randolph, and HR chief Patty McChord deciding who to fire as some of the toughest of his life. The staff was reduced by a third, out of 120 employees, 80 remained. Most of all, Hastings was afraid that the decadent mood that reigned in the team would only intensify after mass layoffs. It was hard for many employees to see their colleagues and friends leave the company in anger and tears. However, the opposite effect worked - after a few weeks, Hastings noticed that the atmosphere in the team had become much better, and the employees were full of energy and optimism. “Suddenly we were able to handle much more work, with 30% fewer employees. To my shock[he told](https://danesmith447.medium.com/netflixs-keeper-test-is-the-secret-to-a-successful-workforce-by-netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-and-2cec85b002d9). That’s how Netflix’s management came up with a hiring principle that they still adhere to: keep only the best and quickly fire an employee if they become worse at work.

As the financial situation stabilized, the company began to open warehouses in different regions of the United States. The decision was made after Netflix noticed that there were significantly more orders from the San Francisco Bay Area than from other regions. “It was a mistake that I waited until 2002 to open regional distribution centers. Same day deliveries have delighted our customers, and before we had too many complaints from subscribers who had to wait too long \[orders\],” Hastings [said.](https://www.inc.com/magazine/20051201/qa-hastings.html)

No room for error
-----------------

At the start of 2002, Netflix had 500,000 subscribers in the US, and the company returned to plans to go public. The firm held an IPO on the NASDAQ on May 23, 2002, on the first day of trading the share price rose from $15 to $16.75. The joy, however, was short-lived. In November, supermarket chain Walmart announced that it was launching its DVD rental service, and the news sent Netflix stock plummeting to $2.50. After two years of confrontation, the retailer curtailed the project - it turned out that it was more profitable for Walmart to sell discs. But immediately the vacant place was taken by a new dangerous rival - Blockbuster. Antioco realized that turning down Netflix's offer was a mistake and decided to catch up on his own. In 2004, the Blockbuster Online DVD rental platform was launched.

Of course, the big advantage of Netflix was the system of selection of recommendations, which became more and more perfect, and a variety of content. Unlike its competitors, the same Blockbuster, the service's library contained not only box office hits, but also author's films - before, such tapes were not even always released to the public. “I was trying to understand how it could happen that all these films appeared at some festivals, and then disappeared from the cultural space,” [said](https://www.marketplace.org/2006/12/08/netflix-expands-indie-film-biz/) Ted Sarandos, head of content and future co-head of the company. So, by 2006, the number of titles in the catalog exceeded 60 thousand. In the same year, Netflix had a subsidiary company, Red Envelope Entertainment, which was engaged in the production of its own content.

It was difficult to fight the old-timer of the Blockbuster market. In less than a year, she managed to attract 1 million subscribers, by the end of 2006 there were already 2 million. In many ways, this became possible thanks to the Blockbuster Total Access service that appeared in the same year: users could not only return discs by mail, but also give them to the nearest network video cassette rental point: in the USA there were 4.7 thousand points and 2.5 thousand in 24 more countries. The number of Netflix subscribers in 2006  [was](http://q4live.s22.clientfiles.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/annual_reports/NFLX.pdf) already 6.3 million, but in 2007 the company [faced](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/22/how-netflix-almost-lost-the-movie-rental-wars-to-blockbuster.html) an outflow of users for the first time. At the same time, Blockbuster's audience continued to grow steadily.

What saved Netflix, however, was fearlessness and a willingness to take risks. Back in 2005, the company began talking about a complete transition to online and prepared to launch a service called Netflix Box. It was meant to allow subscribers to download movies to watch them the next day. But one day, VP of Content Robert Kinkle stumbled upon a new platform that was rapidly gaining popularity: YouTube. “This forced us to curtail the launch and switch to creating a service that would allow users to watch movies online, and not download them,” [said](https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video) Kinkle. And in 2007, Netflix launched the Watch Now streaming service. Initially, it was available only on PC, the number of hours of viewing was limited, and the number of available films did not exceed 1,000. At the same time, the company continued to rent DVDs. The new business model [helped](https://interestingengineering.com/the-fascinating-history-of-netflix) increase the audience by 20% over the previous year, reaching 7.5 million subscribers in 2007.

The innovation, which allowed subscribers not to wait for discs, but to watch movies at any convenient time, helped the company survive the 2008 global financial crisis. To stir up interest in the new product, the company has partnered with manufacturers of video players, game consoles and smart TVs. The service became available on LG Electronics, Samsung, TiVo devices and for subscribers of Microsoft's Xbox Live Internet gaming platform. Although audience growth [slowed](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/technology/internet/30tivo.html) sharply in September, the number of users of the service reached 9.4 million in 2008. In addition, Netflix focused on its core business and [closed](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/netflix-shuts-movie-financing-arm-to-focus-on-core-20080724-3k3b.html)Red Envelope Entertainment to stabilize its financial situation - it will return to creating its own content in more prosperous times. Competent marketing and redistribution of resources paid off: [at the end of the year, the](https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/07/16/2009-netflix-defies-recession/) company's revenue grew by 13% and amounted to $1.4 billion, and profit increased by 24%, to $83 million.

But Blockbuster was unable to recover from the turmoil of 2008. The crisis revealed a long-standing problem for the company - a high debt burden. Blockbuster's loss at the time of the launch of the rental service was about $1 billion on revenue of about $6 billion, while the new division was not profitable. Moreover, the costs only increased when the company allowed subscribers to return discs to rental centers - logistics costs increased. After 2008, banks simply refused to lend to companies with such a leverage. Two years later, Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy. Netflix also began to enter foreign markets and the number of its subscribers in 2010 crossed the mark of 20 million. “If it weren’t for her debts, she \[Blockbuster\] would have simply killed us,” Hastings later admitted.

Over the next two years, Netflix gradually moved away from DVD rentals, spinning off the service into a separate firm. In 2012, the platform launched its first original comedy show, You People Are All the Same. A year later - his first series "House of Cards". At the same time, a new competitor appeared - Amazon Prime Video. Netflix has entered a new era that continues today. Whether she will be able to defend her superiority this time, time will tell.
