title: "Wrong gender: why Russian companies discriminate against men"
description: Talk about discrimination against women in the labor market is already a common place. But men are also disadvantaged, and some categories are even stronger. In particular, the chances of finding a job for older men have been steadily declining since 2010, while those of women are rising.

The media often write about discrimination against women by employers. In fact, almost all categories of the population are infringed on the Russian labor market, employees of recruitment agencies testify. Age, starting from 40-45 years old - for being too old, young - for being too young, men - for choosing a "female" profession, too ambitious and not ready to put up with low wages and poor conditions labor. Between gender holidays, RBC asked HRs which groups of men have it harder than women.

A large domestic agro-industrial holding has been looking for a narrow specialist for a long time: the criteria were very strict. And finally, good luck. “He appears - a handsome prince among the candidates for this position. But in his resume at his last job there was a line: “I was on parental leave for two years,” recalls recruiter Ekaterina Chernomorova, author of the 80lvl.resume project. \- The position was not mine, and I watched my colleagues ask: “Man? On decree? What's wrong with him? He probably has a very rich wife and doesn’t need money!” The break in seniority confused recruiters much less than the young father's stay on maternity leave. However, there was almost no choice - the applicant was called for an interview and made sure that he was competent and adequate. "But the question is, 'What's wrong with him?' — remained. As a result, his resume was sent to the employer along with the resume of the woman, who had less experience and also had a break due to the decree. The employer simply did not consider the man: “What normal man will be on maternity leave ?!” All. And the woman was given a chance,” says Chernomorova.

Behind the justified anger at discrimination against women, it is usually difficult to see situations where men are in the role of oppression. But in reality, almost any HR can easily remember stories with the selection of men that fit into the [definition](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_099154.pdf)International Labor Organization (ILO): “Discrimination in the field of work and occupation means different and less favorable treatment of people due to some inherent properties, such as gender <…>, regardless of their merits and the requirements of this work. Discrimination restricts a person's freedom to get the job they were counting on. Discrimination in the workplace and the labor market is based not on objective facts, but on perceptions of abilities or attitudes attributed to certain groups of people.” Gender discrimination affects even directors: according to a survey by the consulting company Kontakt InterSearch Russia, every fourth male top manager has experienced it at least once.

“Of course, a woman under 27,” was the end of an ad for an office manager posted in February in [the group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sellyourhead/) Facebook (an organization recognized as extremist and banned on the territory of the Russian Federation) Sell Your Head, dedicated to recruitment. Commentators taunted: they forgot to indicate the size of the chest and ask for a photo in a swimsuit. The author of the post said in response that she knows the laws, does not agree with all of them, and the CEO has the right to look for such an employee as he wants. The law expressly prohibits the selection of candidates of a certain gender - “no one can be limited in labor rights and freedoms or receive any benefits depending on gender <...>, as well as on other circumstances not related to the business qualities of an employee,” reads Art. 3 of the Labor Code, but this norm is often and openly violated. Recruiters may not mention gender in the job description, but select resumes based on the verbal orders of the manager. Headhunter company. ru in the fall of 2019 interviewed 117 employers and found out that 96% of them, and in companies with less than 100 employees and all 100%, from time to time look for candidates of a certain gender. There are two main reasons: the requirements of the manager and the specifics of job duties (each scored 64% of respondents' answers). “In other words, these are either the personal internal attitudes of the manager, or gender stereotypes that representatives of a particular gender are better able to cope with certain tasks,” the company comments.

In fact, a manager can be driven by a variety of considerations, starting with ideological ones. “The management of a department in a large company, mostly composed of women, did not like to work with men. The boss and the deputy had pronounced, even with an excess, feminist views and believed that men were bad workers and generally unpleasant characters, - psychologist Elena Dobrobabenko gives an example. \- A male candidate who tried to get a job there was told in plain text that a man would not be able to work “normally” in this position, which is absolutely not related to gender. Moreover, it was important for the management to convey to the applicant: you will not get to us precisely because you are a man, and not because you are not a professional or do not understand something. This is rather an anecdotal case, because of which, nevertheless, not only the candidate, but also the business suffered. However, it is not a fact that the applicant would work well in such a department. According to a study by Headhunter.ru, in 32% of cases, recruiters had to look for a candidate of a certain gender precisely because of the specifics of the team.

According to HeadHunter, the least number of men in personnel management and training, among administrative workers, in accounting and financial accounting, science and education, tourism, hotel and restaurant industries. More than 70% of those employed here are women. The most masculine profession in Russia does not require high qualifications and does not involve work in a cozy office - a security guard. Next to her, where they are looking for men, is the foreman. The men's top five in-demand professions are brightened up by technical specialties traditionally linked to gender - a system administrator, an IT engineer, a programmer.

Victoria Kabakova, project director at Ecopsy Consulting, believes that most often it is about gender stereotypy: certain professions and even industries are considered almost entirely female. As a result, men themselves do not go there. “It is rather a question of weathering the practices of existence and the inclusion of men in these areas. A good example is education. Before the revolution, teachers were predominantly men, in the sociocultural paradigm the sphere was marked as male, and education itself was mostly focused on boys and young men. Then for a long time there was parity. Then, in the post-war period and especially in the 1980s, pedagogy became a women's sphere, and already a young man does not go to a pedagogical university - this is not for boys. The situation was also fixed because at some point the sphere of pedagogy became low-paid, and women were more likely to focus on the predictability of income, rather than on its size - they were more important than stability, legal payments and the ability to combine work with caring for the family. The stereotype has become so ingrained that now many private schools refuse to hire men. “The principal of a private school bluntly explained to the candidate for the position of teacher of elementary grades: it is very strange that a man wants to work with young children. Your parents will think you are a pedophile,” Dobrobabenko recalls. it's very strange that a man wants to work with young children. Your parents will think you are a pedophile,” Dobrobabenko recalls. it's very strange that a man wants to work with young children.

Some are more equal
-------------------

In many Western countries, a few decades ago, the situation with the right of women to work was not easy. Even in enlightened France before 1965, a married woman could only go to work with her husband's permission. However, for more than half a century, human rights have made a huge breakthrough: now in Europe, discrimination against men's rights is increasingly noted. [In a report](https://euagenda.eu/upload/publications/untitled-150339-ea.pdf) published in 2018[](https://euagenda.eu/upload/publications/untitled-150339-ea.pdf)The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofund) "Discrimination against men at work: the experience of five countries" notes a rapid increase in the number of such cases in some countries. The top five are Hungary, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden and Austria. The areas where men face gender-based harassment at work most often are real estate (5.5% of respondents), medicine and social services (3%), and administrative work (2.9%). Another study in Sweden [showed](https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-56213572)that most men who apply for cleaning jobs don't even get to the interview stage. It is also much more difficult for men to get a job as a nurse or kindergarten teacher. And in traditionally “male” professions, such as an auto mechanic, a truck driver or a warehouse worker, there is no discrimination against women. The first cases of men fighting for their rights are also known. The report of the Eurofund mentions a case when a Belgian citizen, who was refused to consider him for the position of administrative assistant (the company motivated the refusal by the fact that it was looking for women), went to court and received compensation from the employer in the amount of €5308.

Just don't let him come

However, there are deeper reasons that employers do not really like to talk about. Often women are preferred because they are less demanding. “Women are trouble-free: you can reduce your salary, change your schedule, etc. Men in such a situation quit themselves,” says Svetlana Gorelik, author of the Iloveresume project. In addition, women are often paid less than men for the same work, recalls Timur Aslanov, head of the Image-Media publishing house. “She spent the same amount of time, she has the same qualifications, but she is a woman, which means she cannot be worth as much as a man. This is how many employers think. A man needs to feed his family or take care of girls and pay for them in a cafe, he is more ambitious and has more expenses. Both suffer from this stereotype. Women get less money. And men are not hired for some positions because they want to save money. If you are a man, it will be extremely difficult for you to get a job as an office manager, dispatcher, personnel manager, seller, except for household goods, spare parts, household and other equipment stores. It is especially difficult at the start, in the positions of interns and young professionals. When hiring a PR, marketer, advertising manager, or designer, many employers will also choose a girl over a boy. A girl is easier to manage, she can be paid less, she will look less sideways, ”explains Aslanov. positions of interns and young specialists.

The fact that men are considered to be more ambitious often does them a disservice. “Despite the fact that in vacancies we no longer see the phrases: “Required a man, under 35 years of age, in / about”, discrimination by sex, age and other grounds still exists. But I would not be in a hurry to associate this with man-hating sentiments; the fault, most likely, is the subjective experience of the manager,” Irina Khomenko, HR expert at HeadHunter.ru, is convinced. \- I know a situation when the financial director tried not to take guys for the position of a treasury specialist, despite the fact that he himself was a man. The fact is that he considered the work routine. And the position itself - with little potential for career growth. And when the HR team offered him to look at the resumes of candidates, he immediately said: “Not a single guy stayed with me for more than six months. And the average period of work of my employees is three years. So try to argue with such statistics.

A prime example of labor discrimination, the field of accounting illustrates another widespread stereotype. “I only know two men in this profession. I personally worked with one, and the second is the hero of the song “Accountant,” laughs Svetlana Kuzmina, head of the recruitment, integration and development of the employer brand at FM Logistic. \- Most employers favor men in finance - for example, in the role of the head of the financial control department or financial director, but I could not remember that one of the hiring chief accountants asked me to find a young man for the position of an accountant in the bank-client section, for example . Perhaps this is a kind of hidden compliment to men, since they are more seen as strategists, ambitious leaders, not wanting to give them routine and monotonous work. Nevertheless, there are much fewer places for "strategists",

Stereotypes can be dangerous because they force managers to make decisions based not on the real competencies of a particular person, but on some ideas of how he will feel in a position, how colleagues and clients will react to him. Employers design a certain behavior of the candidate for the intended position, and it does not always have something to do with reality, Kabakov warns. “Male candidates are often not considered for positions that require stereotypically “feminine” skills – mindfulness, perseverance, ability to do repetitive, monotonous work, accuracy, attention to detail.

There is a list of stereotypically “female” positions, for example, receptionist, personal assistant to the manager, IT recruiter (there is an opinion that the presence of beautiful women will attract more young talented programmers; moreover, there is a specificity of finding IT specialists on Tinder and other dating services ). As a rule, girls look at them first of all,” comments Alexander Maslyuk, SAP CIS HR transformation expert. Business owners often try to use the gender advantages of managers to implement various types of tasks, explains Natalya Venerova, CEO of the Perspektiva Center for Business and Career Development. “Many of them believe that it is better to appoint women to top positions related to constant communication, for example, director of marketing, HR director, director of administrative affairs,

Such a different age
--------------------

Not only is it more difficult for men to get into certain positions, in fact, they leave the labor market much earlier. [Research](https://www.ranepa.ru/images/News/2019-05/16-05-2019-firo.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1pAubLywBUWhODcLK_gDI1EkkVsegydmtFtzSMdmwenvHuGsHcBIRhErQ) results published in 2019[](https://www.ranepa.ru/images/News/2019-05/16-05-2019-firo.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1pAubLywBUWhODcLK_gDI1EkkVsegydmtFtzSMdmwenvHuGsHcBIRhErQ)RANEPA testify: in 2010-2017, the chances of finding a job in older men decreased for all workers, except for specialists of pre-retirement age with a secondary vocational education. On the other hand, the chances of employment for women of pre-retirement age have increased for all groups, except for the least educated job seekers. For example, women with higher education aged 50 to 54 are almost 1.5 times more likely to find a job than their male peers with the same level, and those aged 55 to 59 are almost twice as likely. The chances of finding a job for men with primary vocational education have fallen especially sharply (by 40% over seven years).

According to the conclusions of RANEPA analysts, women over 50 are insured by the traditional predominance of women in healthcare and public services. For example, there are five times more women of retirement age in the civil service than men. “Since we are talking about people of pre-retirement and retirement ages, it must be taken into account that it is different for women and men, that is, men are older,” notes Mark Agranovich, director of the Research Center for Monitoring and Statistics of Education FIRO RANEPA. "Besides, men's health is on average worse than women's, and they are more employed in jobs that require physical strength." Recruitment consultant Yevgenia Tudaletskaya states a rather cynical pattern: “Since the average life expectancy for men is much lower, personnel officers prefer to hire retired women rather than men.”

Not as much as women, older men were affected by such fashionable concepts as the digital transformation of companies and the knowledge economy. Among workers in agricultural enterprises and unskilled and semi-skilled workers, as many as 37% are men over 50 years old and only 20% are women of the same age. More than half of women over 50 years of age and only one third of men are engaged in highly professional activities. It should be noted that all these figures refer to the era before the pandemic - based on more recent data, the picture may be even worse.
