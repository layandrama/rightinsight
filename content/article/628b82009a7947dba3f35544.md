Most of us know the principle of investors that you cannot invest in those companies whose activities you do not understand and cannot analyze. Surprisingly, many people completely ignore this principle and get involved in the game of picking individual stocks on the basis of their "deep understanding". In technology trends, misguided self-confidence does not always lead to bad consequences, as there are cases where the growth of companies coincides with consumer acceptance of their products, as, for example, with Apple or Microsoft.

But there are industries where even experienced professionals and analysts continue to regularly make investment mistakes. At the same time, the industry continues to develop and sometimes bring significant profits to individual investors. Let's see what stage the biotech industry is in, events in which have attracted wide investor interest over the past decade.

**Depression or blues?**

After the world events of March 2020, the attention of investors was focused on the biotech sector much more than usual. More than 100 biotech companies went public that year alone — twice as many as in 2019 — raising more than $20 billion. companies will enter the market before they run out of free funds and the sentiment changes. All the negative options that the naysayers had warned about were realized faster than even they expected.

**Don't miss out**

The S&P Biotech SPDR exchange-traded fund, known under the ticker XBI, has lost more than 60% from its peak in February last year and is on track to close at its lowest level since early 2017. The 15-month drop is considered the longest since the fund's inception in 2006.

For biotech companies that have experienced research failures or are years away from bringing drugs to market, the economic downturn will lead to a rapid decline in cash reserves and then painful cost cuts. For example, Bluebird Bio Inc., which is developing gene replacement therapy for the treatment of rare diseases, said in April that it would cut its costs by 40% and its staff by 30% in order to survive in the first half of next year. And Solid Biosciences Inc., which is developing a gene therapy to treat muscular dystrophy, said it would cut staff by 35% to fund its operations through the second quarter of 2024.

**Opinion**

1.  “Many companies thought they could raise funding at such astronomically high valuations any time they needed money,” says Leonard Schleifer, chief executive of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. — a biotech company that went two decades before its first drug was approved in 2008. “But when there’s no market and valuations are down and they need money, there’s a problem.”
2.  A suppressed market always leads to thoughts of potentially large mergers and acquisitions. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee says the top 20 pharma giants have about $300 billion in cash to spare, while the combined capitalization of all biotech companies valued at less than $5 billion is about $350 billion.
    
    “If we look specifically at the biotechnology market, we see that more money is being invested in venture capital projects and private companies, and not in the stock market,” said the director of BDO Life Sciences. He noted that the volume of private equity and venture capital funds with a focus on biotechnology increased by 113%. Such statistics are explained by the desire of investors to find highly specialized investment teams in the industry.
    
3.  The leaders of many of the world's pharmaceutical giants believe that "biotech prices" still have room to fall before they become potentially profitable acquisitions. Although mergers and acquisitions are very often used as a means of replenishing portfolios by large players, it seems that this time they will be much more selective. Roche CEO Severin Schwan noted that the fall in biotech valuations in recent months was only a course correction to 2019 and 2020 levels. “Even then, I was worried about high valuations, so even despite the correction, I still believe that we should be very selective in relation to any mergers and acquisitions,” he said.

**Numbers**

Almost 200 North American biotech companies have a negative market value, that is, their current capitalization is below the value of liquid assets. At the same time, there have been several M&A deals between major pharmaceutical and biotech companies this year, such as GlaxoSmithKline's $1.9 billion purchase of rare cancer specialist Sierra Oncology or Pfizer's $525 million acquisition of privately held biotech company ReViral. .

Developments

**Where to look:** PFE, BIIB stocks

*   As record revenues from the COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral pills are expected to decline, Pfizer continues to make acquisitions to sustain its growth. Specifically, it agreed to buy American biotech company Biohaven Pharmaceuticals for $11.6 billion, in the biggest deal in more than five years. Biohaven, founded in 2013, specializes in drugs for the treatment of neurological diseases and rare disorders. Its most famous drug is Nurtec ODT, approved for the treatment and prevention of migraine in adults.

*   Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos will step down after the failed launch of Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm. The group said Tuesday it has begun searching for a successor and is dismantling its global sales infrastructure for the drug; this will save $500 million in annual costs. In April, US government-funded health insurance programs imposed severe caps on funding for Aduhelm ($28,000 a year) for patient care.

*   McKinsey analyzed the dynamics of biotech stocks for 2018-2021 and believes that what happened in the market is more likely caused by the overall dynamics of the S&P 500, rather than fundamental changes in the industry and the loss of growth prospects. Companies with positive test results and sufficient cash reserves have every chance to surprise investors with growth, but exceptionally growing companies should rethink their strategies in the current environment - carefully analyze their management and fundraising models, focus more on cooperation with large companies and commercial partnerships.

Company
-------

**Where to watch:** AZN shares

**The nobility of the great**

Per

*   AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN) is one of the top 10 biopharmaceutical companies in the world in terms of revenue. Significant progress in portfolio development in recent years and a number of acquisitions have enabled the British-Swedish company to significantly increase revenue and net income in recent quarters. It focused on the development of drugs for the treatment of oncology and rare diseases. AstraZeneca earned $11.4 billion in the past first quarter, up almost 56% from the same period last year.
*   The company has the highest gross margin among the 15 leading pharmaceutical giants - about 80% at the beginning of the year. This suggests that the management continues to effectively manage the business, despite the negative impact of external factors that led to higher prices for raw materials and equipment.

Against

*   Profit after taxes fell 75% to $388 million from $1.6 billion last year. One reason for the big drop was the settlement of a patent dispute with Chugai Pharmaceutical, which cost AstraZeneca $775 million. Earnings per share were $0.25, down 79% from $1.18 a year earlier.
*   AstraZeneca continues to sell COVID-19 vaccines at near cost. The vaccine, called Vaxzevria, brought in $1.1 billion in revenue in the past first quarter. The company, although it sees the commercial potential of the drug in the future, continues to practically lose money.
