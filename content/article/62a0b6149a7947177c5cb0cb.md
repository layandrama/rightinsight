The pandemic has been a mixed and difficult period for SoftBank. After the crisis with co-working chain WeWork, whose valuation fell from $40 billion to a "modest" $6 billion, and the sell-off of more than $41 billion in assets, SoftBank seemed to be able to not only become a profitable company again, but also break a national record.

If March 2020 was the most unfortunate for SoftBank in the history of the company due to [losses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/technology/softbank-jack-ma.html) of $12.7 billion, then a year later, in May 2021, the head of the corporation, Masayoshi Son, spoke about a record profit of $46 billion. This amount became the largest not only in the history of SoftBank, but also in the history of Japanese business.

SoftBank began its return to the camp of profitable companies at the end of the summer of 2020, when, despite an internal management crisis and [the departure](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/technology/softbank-jack-ma.html) of Jack Ma from the board of directors, the corporation was able to earn $12 billion in a quarter. Then the media [attributed](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/softbank-2020-results.html) success to the growing capitalization of IT companies from the SoftBank portfolio - like Slack and Uber.

The new fiscal year 2022 was a repeat of the history of two years ago for the Japanese company: SoftBank failed to sell the British processor manufacturer Arm to the American Nvidia, and the correction on the stock exchange of IT companies negatively affected the financial performance of the corporation. As a result, an annual [loss](https://www.businessinsider.com/softbank-on-brink-debt-threshold-rout-sends-bets-into-freefall-2022-5?international=true&r=US&IR=T) of $ 26.2 billion.

Will Masayoshi Son and SoftBank manage to deal with record losses once again, or is this time serious?

Failure with Arm
----------------

One of the main reasons for SoftBank's failures is cited by the media as the failed sale of British chip maker Arm to American Nvidia. Back in 2020, the latter announced an agreement: the parties agreed to cede ownership of the company for $40 billion. Later, the value of Arm rose to $66 billion, but not the price, but the attention of regulators around the world did not allow Nvidia and SoftBank to finalize the agreement.

For Nvidia, the purchase of Arm meant expansion into the market for energy-efficient processors: the architecture of the British company is licensed by manufacturers of mobile processors, and for some time now also by manufacturers of other gadgets (for example, Apple). Had the deal been approved, Nvidia would have paid $21.5 billion in stock and $12 billion in cash. With certain undisclosed results, SoftBank could receive up to an additional $5 billion, and Arm employees would also receive a $1.5 billion Nvidia stake.

As a result of the deal, SoftBank could become the owner of 10% of Nvidia. In 2019, SoftBank-owned Vision Fund got rid of all the shares in the company that it owned. The amount of the sale at that time [was](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/06/softbank-vision-fund-sells-nvidia-stake.html) $ 3.6 billion, and SoftBank did not explain its decision in any way. Analysts tried to find the logic: CNBC clarifies that four months before the sale of Vision Fund shares, their value decreased by almost 50%. Nvidia has had a tough year in 2019, with its fourth-quarter guidance sharply lowering revenue expectations “due to the difficult macroeconomic environment, especially in China.”

{{<ads>}}

On February 7, the cancellation of the deal [was officially](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-softbank-group-announce-termination-of-nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-limited) announced : Nvidia promised to continue cooperation with Arm, and SoftBank announced the start of preparations for the placement of shares of the British company on the stock exchange. The Japanese corporation noted that this should happen before the end of March 2023. Arm said it was ready to be a public company and changed management.

The new CEO, René Haas, began a new chapter in the history of Arm with a [promise](https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/arm-ceo-ipo-plans) to make the company entrusted to him as attractive as possible for investors by the IPO date. To correct the financial situation, with which, according to Haas, there are no problems, they began with a reduction in staff by 15%. At the same time, the company's financial performance can hardly be called negative: in mid-May, Arm reported revenue of $2.7 billion and a profit of $1 billion - 35% more than a year earlier.

Despite the failed sale, SoftBank plans to capitalize on Arm and will remain one of the largest shareholders of the company after it goes public, the media specify. Masayoshi Son [told](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-21/softbank-plans-to-retain-controlling-stake-in-arm-after-ipo) [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/) that his company plans to launch Arm's IPO as soon as possible, but if volatility in the stock markets continues, SoftBank is ready to wait for a better moment.

To reassure regulators in the US, EU and China that any potential deal with Arm after an attempt to sell it to Nvidia is considered a threat to national security, industry representatives [decided](https://www.ft.com/content/eab1d19d-ab4c-45b7-88b4-f1f5e115d16e) thanks to a consortium of investors. The main claim to the failed deal was that the American company obtained control over the licenses for the production of processors from its direct competitors. The community of investors with equal shares in a public company, as conceived by industry representatives, should solve this problem.

Arm's largest client, Qualcomm, an American manufacturer of mobile processors, offered to maintain Arm's neutrality. According to the head of the company Cristiano Amon, when Arm was still public, she managed not only to remain neutral, but also to profit from all divisions of the company. “It’s all about collective ownership of the rights to the entire ecosystem,” Amon explained to the Financial Times, implying that Arm was owned by Qualcomm, Apple and other players in the chip market before it was bought by SoftBank. Whether the proposed option will suit Arm, SoftBank, the industry and regulators is still unclear.

Failed report
-------------

It wasn't just Arm that caused SoftBank to fail. In mid-May, the company reported on the results of fiscal 2021, which ended on March 31 for the organization, and this report became one of the worst in the history of the company. SoftBank's two investment funds, Vision Fund 1 and 2, [generated](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/softbank-to-slash-investments-by-more-than-half-this-year-ceo-masayoshi-son/articleshow/91518596.cms) a net investment loss of nearly $27 billion. From the rest of SoftBank's business, SoftBank also suffered record losses of $16.5 billion. key rates in a number of countries, as well as the pressure of the Chinese authorities on the IT sector.

For example, in April 2021, the Chinese company Alibaba, which is part of the SoftBank portfolio, received an antitrust fine of $2.8 billion. As a result, the retailer's shares fell by 31%. Chinese taxi aggregator Didi and South Korean online trading platform Coupang lost even more value. The latter has set [an unfortunate record](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/softbank-to-slash-investments-by-more-than-half-this-year-ceo-masayoshi-son/articleshow/91518596.cms), causing more losses than all other SoftBank assets - now its shares are trading 70% below the IPO price.

During the announcement of the financial report, Masayoshi Son [assured](https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-alibaba-stake-in-spotlight-amid-stock-market-turbulence-11648287003?mod=article_inline) shareholders that SoftBank will be able to cope with the difficulties. The founder of the corporation, in particular, proposes to do this by reducing the share of Chinese companies in the portfolio. However, SoftBank's problems are not only in China.

{{<ads>}}

About $4 billion, or 9% of the total capital of Vision Fund 2, SoftBank invested in companies from India. In 2018, the Japanese corporation began to expand its presence in the country and even opened its own office. Thus, by 2022, 21 "unicorns" from India appeared in the SoftBank portfolio - these are companies with an estimated value of more than $1 billion.

Financial problems have reduced the pace of investment in the region, and the projects in which SoftBank continued to invest, the company began to select with particular care, [writes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/india-shows-the-challenge-in-firming-up-softbank-11654599780?mod=markets_major_pos2) The Wall Street Journal. At the same time, companies from India, already in the portfolio, also show not the best result: for example, the payment company Paytm has lost more than 70% since the IPO, bringing the Japanese conglomerate a net loss of $600 million out of $1.4 billion invested.

Belt tightening
---------------

The founder and head of SoftBank, Masayoshi Son, said that in the current unfavorable conditions, the corporation is moving towards a "defensive" style of investing. Stricter criteria will be applied in selecting new companies to invest in, and in general, funds will become more conservative in the process, and in particular be wary of supporting Chinese companies. However, a wary attitude, as the head of the conglomerate emphasized, does not mean a reduction in investment to zero.

“We believe that there are still a large number of large companies \[in China\] that we would like to invest in, but on a comparatively smaller scale, ” Song [said.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/12/softbank-vision-fund-posts-record-27-billion-loss-as-tech-stocks-dive.html)

More specifically, the company is going to cut the volume of investments: this year it will be only a third or a quarter of the amount invested in 2021. Son [believes](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/softbank-to-slash-investments-by-more-than-half-this-year-ceo-masayoshi-son/articleshow/91518596.cms) that the entire startup ecosystem will soon experience a period of slowdown due to macroeconomic factors and the ongoing crisis in Eastern Europe.

At the same time, SoftBank cut the salaries of leading top managers amid record losses in two of its investment funds, Vision Fund 1 and 2, [writes the](https://www.ft.com/content/a993bdb1-17d7-46e4-9ed4-ad7d57b20337) Financial Times. The salary of billionaire Masayoshi Son has remained unchanged - approximately $ 785 thousand per year. But the salary of CFO Yoshimitsu Goto decreased from the previous year by $1.39 million, to $2.3 million. The income of the head of the telecom division of SoftBank Ken Miyauchi decreased over the year from $4.73 million to $4.66 million.

Common problems
---------------

Similar difficulties arose with one of the main competitors of the Japanese company - Tiger Global Management fund. The result [was](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Tech-startup-layoffs-top-20-000-amid-big-funding-chill) massive layoffs at tech startups around the world. So, the Thrasio aggregator fires 20% of the staff, the American Reef Technology - 5%, or 750 people.

Speaking about the reasons for the current situation, expert William Janeway, in a [commentary](https://www.ft.com/content/6a137523-26d5-4285-8b98-c273f1fb6d1a) for the Financial Times, turned to the recent past. “The central banks of the world have implemented a set of economic and financial measures that we have never seen before: sustainable negative interest rates for the long term,” he said. As a result, some companies have relied on capital and started investing, ignoring traditional investment indicators. Janeway thinks it was a bad decision.

Investors are now distinguishing between tech companies that generate solid cash flow and profits - like Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet - and riskier investments like Netflix, Peloton or Zoom.
