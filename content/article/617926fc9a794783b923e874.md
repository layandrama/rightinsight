Etsy is now the world's largest marketplace specializing in handmade and vintage items, with more than 4 million sellers on the platform. The company claims the glory of eBay and Amazon, although it was originally supposed to become their antipode

Englishwoman Lois Callie-Smith has been professionally designing textile accessories for more than ten years, from shopping bags to cosmetic bags and wallets. One day, she thought that the patterns she developed could be useful to those who simply love to sew at their leisure. However, she never had enough time to implement the idea. But during the quarantine, Callie-Smith had plenty of it, and she spent several months creating patterns and learning the basics of SEO marketing. In June 2020, the designer launched the Molko store on Etsy, a marketplace specializing in handicrafts and vintage items.

“While the world was in quarantine, many decided to get sewing machines and get creative,” the designer says about the reasons for the popularity of his store. “It was a chance to learn something new, return to old hobbies, finish a thing that started six months ago, or even open your own business.” One pattern costs $9.06-10.36 depending on the size of the product. In the first month, Callie-Smith sold 100 patterns, and by the end of October 2021, the number of Molko sales reached 4.3 thousand.

For those who, like Callie-Smith, make money on needlework or simply prefer handmade items to the mass market, Etsy remains a key platform. The American marketplace has become one of the triumphs of 2020 due to the successful coincidence of the DIY trend and the online trading boom. Annual revenue grew by 128% compared to the same indicator for 2019 and amounted to $1.7 billion, profit reached $349.2 million ($95.8 million in 2019). The number of active sellers increased from 2.7 million to 4.4 million, and active buyers from 46.4 million to 81.9 million.

What’s more, according to eMarketer as of July 2021, Etsy is the leader among US retailers in terms of online sales growth. “People suddenly started putting Etsy on a par with much bigger retailers like Walmart, Target or eBay,” CEO Josh Silverman said earlier this year. But it all started with a desire to earn some extra money and challenge large corporations.

From the "modern guild" to the IPO
----------------------------------

In 2005, Rob Kalin was 24 years old. By this point, he had changed five universities and several jobs: Kalin managed to be a cashier in a supermarket, a warehouse worker, a secretary to a philosophy professor, a seller in a bookstore and a builder. In addition, he earned money by making wooden furniture. However, not very successfully, because there was simply no suitable resource for selling such goods. At the same time, Kalin, along with his university friend Chris Maguire, helped to redesign the forum for those who are fond of needlework. After reading the discussions on the site, Kalin was convinced that his problem was not unique: users complained to each other that it was difficult to sell things they made by themselves. eBay was not suitable for this purpose. Firstly, the commissions that the site took were constantly growing, and, secondly, everything was sold there - against this background, handmade things lost their value. Then the friends decided to make a convenient site that would help people monetize their hobbies and become something like a modern guild - a close-knit community of "craftsmen" of the 21st century.

{{<ads>}}


Together with another university acquaintance, programmer Chaim Shoppic, they made the site in six weeks. The first investors were two local developers and one restaurant owner, whom Kalin once worked part-time - he received a check for $50,000 even before the launch and $100,000 within six months after. Called Etsy, the company's business model was new for its time and much more attractive to sellers with modest start-up capital and low volumes. The company took a fixed commission of $0.20 for placing an item on the site and another 3.5% of its price if the item was bought (eBay, for example, at that time had 40 different rates for different cases). Registration was free for both sellers and buyers.

The terms were very favorable. In addition, most sellers did not have sufficient skills and resources to make their own website, and it is much easier to promote products on a common platform. Etsy's popularity has skyrocketed. Kalin, who took over as CEO, was constantly in touch with his clients, chatting with them on forums and arranging offline meetings to find out how he could make the site better. Soon a tagging system was created to simplify the search, and more and more tools for personalizing online storefronts appeared. Kalin stated that the community is above all, and refused to call sellers and buyers "users", believing that this depersonalizes them. “Etsy is basically hundreds of thousands of small companies, and I want to keep this “intimate” atmosphere as we grow and the number of people grows, who need our support,” Kalin said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He opposed Etsy to large corporations and admitted to a lack of sympathy for "people from the world of business and technology."

However, Kalin's idealism did not prevent Etsy from quickly achieving impressive financial results. By May 2007, the company's sales reached $1.7 million, and by November of the same year it had crossed the $4.3 million mark. this and that. As a result, sales for 2008 already reached $87.5 million. Investors drew attention to the company: in 2006, the New York venture fund Union Square Ventures invested in Etsy, and two years later the company raised another $27 million in a new round of financing - Ironically, this time the biggest investor was Jim Breuer, who was on the board of directors of Walmart, which embodied everything Kalin disliked so much.

By this point, it was already obvious that Etsy's management system needed to be reformed. Kalin surrounded himself with the same enthusiasts as himself. This set the direction for the firm's corporate culture, which encouraged creative thinking, self-expression, and openness. However, Kalin's lack of managerial experience made itself felt. “Every day he had some new idea,” Maguire recalled. “Usually they didn’t make any sense. Well, how do you imagine learning blacksmithing online?” Unable to bear the chaos, he and Shoppic left Etsy in the same year 2008 (Maguire later described the experience at the firm as "abusive"). Among other things, site users began to complain about low speed and technical failures. Realizing that the company needs a traditional management system, Kalin stepped down as CEO to the more experienced Maria Thomas, who had previously served as the firm's COO, and hired Chad Dickerson as CTO. During the leadership of Thomas, the company doubled its revenue and was able to cross the break-even threshold.

But a year later, Kalin demanded to return his powers: he convinced investors that Thomas pays all attention exclusively to the company's finances, and this has a devastating effect on its values ​​and culture. Kalin doubled the staff of Etsy and decided to turn it into a kind of social network for craftsmen. The site, for example, has a blog, the ability to add other users as friends, and a gift selection service. Kalin believed that this was how Etsy carried out its true mission - the creation and development of a "community of artisans." However, investors had completely different ideas about the future of the company. They still wanted to see it as a profitable marketplace, and not “the second Facebook (the organization was recognized as extremist and banned on the territory of the Russian Federation).” In 2011, Etsy experienced a new power shift: Kalin was fired by investors and Dickerson took his place.

Perhaps the key decision of the new leader was to change the rules of the site. Since its inception, Etsy has only been able to sell handmade items or vintage items over 20 years old. Factory-made items were strictly prohibited. There were still violators, for which the company was repeatedly criticized both by other sellers and by buyers. However, there was another, much more serious consequence. Because of the ban, many successful salespeople had to work non-stop. “Forget good sleep! How did I sell 1.6 thousand products in the first year? I did not sleep!" \- such posts could be found on the Etsy blog in 2010. Many could not withstand the load and were forced to leave the service. In 2013, Dickerson eased the restrictions by allowing the display of factory-made goods, if the seller himself designed them and provided Etsy with information about the manufacturer. Despite the dissatisfaction of some users, this helped increase sales and attract new sellers: if the sales volume for 2012 was $895.2 million, by the end of 2013 it had already reached $1.3 billion, and the number of stores increased from 830 thousand to 1 million .

Dickerson also managed to maintain and strengthen the company culture that is comfortable for employees. He held weekly "consultations" for employees, when any of them could come to his office to ask a question or complain. Etsy hosted meetings for the entire team, during which employees performed musical numbers. As a sign of concern for the environment, the company did not build itself a fashionable headquarters, but restored an old abandoned building in Brooklyn for this purpose. What's more, in 2012, Etsy received a B Corporation certification, denoting that the firm meets strict criteria for social and environmental performance.

By the end of 2014, Etsy had raised a total of $97.3 million in venture capital, and it was clear that the next step was an IPO. In April 2015, the company was listed on NASDAQ, during which it was valued at $3.5 billion. And despite the fact that the value of the shares doubled to $31 on the first day of trading, by February 2016, the shares had fallen in price by almost five once. The financial results disappointed investors: revenue grew slowly, expenses grew quickly, the company was in the red. The desire of the company to rely on its own strength in everything was not always justified. So, Etsy used its own data centers, instead of moving to more efficient solutions like Amazon Web Services. Despite all the efforts, the culture turned out to be imperfect. The staff got along well with each other.

All of this alarmed Josh Silverman, a new board member who previously held key positions at eBay, Skype, and American Express. He was frightened that Dickerson was talking about entering foreign markets, although financial indicators indicated an impending crisis. He tried to put pressure on management, hoping that the company's leaders would increase sales, but this did not lead to anything. Other investors started talking about a change in leadership. “The house was on fire, but no one paid attention to it,” said Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, who chaired the board of directors. “Chad \[Dickerson\] did everything he could for the company. We needed someone to take her to the next level." It was decided that Josh Silverman would take over the task.

"Customers, Customers and More Customers"
-----------------------------------------

The start of the new CEO was not the easiest, and not only because of the company's financial problems. Etsy employees adored Dickerson and were shocked to learn of his departure. During his farewell speech, everyone wept. The new leader was greeted as a "hostile force".

Silverman's first strategic decision was about the company's management structure and did nothing to make him popular, although it was necessary. According to him, too many employees were managers and too many of these leaders had too few subordinates. In order for the team to work more productively, a more conservative, “vertical” structure was needed. On his first day in office, in addition to Dickerson, Silverman laid off another 79 people - this was the largest staff reduction in the entire history of Etsy. The record was broken two months later, when another 140 employees were laid off.

Silverman understood that Etsy needed a radical change of course if it was to be financially successful. He announced that the company, which has always cared about the sellers and their community first, should shift the focus to the buyers. “I think Etsy, like many other peer-to-peer marketplaces, had such a strong empathy for sellers that it began to forget about empathy for buyers,” Silverman later explained. \- And if you talk to the seller, you will understand that he needs three things. He needs customers, customers, and more customers, in that order.”

He changed the KPI system, leaving only one key indicator for the team - gross sales. In order to save money, time and effort, it was decided to leave only those initiatives that contribute to its growth. Silverman closed all other projects, including the just-launched Etsy Studio, an “additional” marketplace that sold creative materials. A year later, the Etsy Wholesale platform, where users could sell goods in bulk, stopped working. “We stopped doing half of what we were doing. By the end of my fifth week in the role, almost everyone in the company had new tasks, ”said Silverman. The team is now divided into teams of up to ten people (leader, up to six developers, designer and analysts), each of which works on a specific problem during the year.

The growth in sales also required changes in the conditions for sellers. In 2018, Etsy introduced the new Etsy Plus paid plan. For $10 a month, the seller received a budget to promote their store on the site, discounts on customized packaging and business cards, access to showcase personalization tools, and other bonuses. The basic plan remains free of charge. At the same time, the company raised the commission on sales to 5%, explaining that the money will go to marketing purposes, which, however, did not sound too convincing to users.

But what pissed them off even more was another innovation: free shipping. In mid-2019, Etsy effectively gave sellers an ultimatum: either they introduce free shipping on all orders over $35, or their items won't rank high in search results. Moreover, initially the company also offered to include the cost of delivery in the price of the goods, but this caused an outflow of customers and the idea had to be abandoned. Still, the salespeople were angry and confused. Many felt that Etsy had departed from its principles and offered them to "compete with eBay and Amazon."

The firm has gone to great lengths to improve the customer experience: offering money-back guarantees to shoppers in the event of a problem, launching sales, getting salespeople to set clear delivery times, and introducing a new rating system for stores. Etsy has also begun to embrace new technologies. Artificial intelligence helped make the search more accurate (for example, the algorithm determines which of the 43 styles, from “minimalistic” to “romantic”, this or that product belongs). In February 2020, the firm finally migrated the site's infrastructure to Google Cloud, making it faster and more reliable. And this year, tools based on augmented reality technology appeared: with their help, for example, you can see how this or that product will look in the interior.

After Etsy's financials stabilized, Silverman embarked on a massive M&A strategy. In July 2018, the company bought its competitor, the German handicraft marketplace DaWanda. A year later, Etsy paid $275 million for Reverb, a musical instrument reselling platform. In the summer of 2021, the company closed two more major deals - it acquired the Italian resale service Depop, which is very popular with zoomers, for $1.6 billion and the Brazilian marketplace Elo7 for $217 million. Thus, the company was able to significantly expand its audience and increase its presence in Europe and South America. And at the same time took another step towards the status of a global corporation.

Silverman certainly achieved his goal. If the revenue for 2017 was $441.2 million, then in 2019 it was already $818.8 million. In his first year as CEO, he brought the company into a plus. Gross sales are also growing steadily, from $3.3 billion in 2017 to $4.9 billion in 2019 and a staggering $10.3 billion in 2020. Of course, if it were not for the pandemic, the growth in indicators last year would not have been so impressive. However, one should not attribute everything solely to an excess of free time and free funds among the population, the resourcefulness of management also played its role. When the world faced a shortage of masks, Etsy employees sent instructions to sellers on how to sew them and recommendations on choosing materials. At the end of 2020, the marketplace sold masks for $740 million.

This year, the company's results are expectedly more modest: first of all, this is due to the easing of restrictions and the gradual return of customers to stores. If Etsy's revenue growth in the second quarter of 2020 was 137% compared to the same indicator for the previous year, then in the second quarter of 2021 it was 23.4%. However, this does not bother investors. Despite fluctuations in the first half of the year, the value of the company's shares reached a record high at the end of October and continues to grow.

Analysts are confident that under Silverman's leadership, Etsy will continue to strengthen its position and that its concept allows the company to stand out from the competition. The trend towards conscious consumption and attention to environmental issues also contributes to an increase in demand for vintage and handicrafts from local producers. So far, perhaps the main problem of the company is low consumer loyalty. Unlike rivals like Amazon and eBay, Etsy is not a regular shopping site. “In addition to bringing new customers to Etsy, we work hard to ensure that they come back, and not because of any special occasion, but for everyday things, from a personalized rug in the hallway to a unique chess set,” explained Ryan, head of marketing for the company. Scott.

But sellers themselves are seeing less and less of a difference between Etsy and Amazon. Many complain that the site has lost its charm, and the feeling of a close-knit community, trust in the company is irretrievably lost. The company no longer asks them for feedback, does not arrange master classes once a month, as it was before, the conditions have become worse. But still no one is in a hurry to leave the platform. “Your website is like a lemonade stand in the middle of the desert. Etsy is the world's largest craft fair. What will you choose? \- says one of the sellers. They had to admit (albeit not without disappointment) that abandoning the romantic ideals of the early years is part of the process of growing up, and this is also true in the corporate world, and this Etsy is better than none at all. “People will criticize any change to increase sales if it is a progressive business, explains Alison Feldman, who worked at Etsy from 2007 to 2017. But it's not a charitable organization. We live in a capitalist world."
