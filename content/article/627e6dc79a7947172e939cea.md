title: "Why NFT sales have collapsed"
description: The NFT market is “storming” for the second time in six months. And if for the first time interest in non-fungible tokens only increased due to scandals, today everything is different and the volume of transactions with them has fallen sharply. Why and for how long?

“I don’t even know ... They look quite replaceable,” Elon Musk [wrote](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1521807738317066240) on his Twitter page in early May. The billionaire put on the avatar of his social network account a collage of several "bored monkeys" - NFTs, which were supposed to be sold at Sotheby's auction. The author of the picture [replied to](https://twitter.com/michaelbouhanna/status/1521799776630628353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1521799776630628353%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F99397%2Fapecoin-jumped-double-digits-elon-musk-adds-bored-ape-collage-twitter-profile) Musk, asking him to delete it, and offered the billionaire the original NFT, released with the owner's approval.

The billionaire never answered the offer and only changed his avatar. Musk's attention, which is often followed by an explosive growth in assets, did not help this time, and since the beginning of May, the NFT market has been declining and giving alarm signals.

The dramatic decline in sales has led many investors and analysts to believe that the bubble that has been inflating throughout 2021 has burst. However, there are those who are sure that everything is not so bad. Who is right, optimists or pessimists?

Heralds of collapse
-------------------

On May 3, in an article in The Wall Street Journal, experts and analysts [announced](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nft-sales-are-flatlining-11651552616) that the NFT market is experiencing the largest collapse in its short history. The peak of sales occurred in September last year, when about 225 thousand transactions were concluded daily, while now it is only 19 thousand, which is 92% less. The number of active NFT wallets also decreased: by 88%, from 119 thousand to 14 thousand.

The reduction also affected the scale of transactions. On May 8, only $52 million worth of NFTs were [sold](https://dune.com/rchen8/opensea) on the largest specialized marketplace OpenSea , while back in April the daily amount of transactions was about $100 million.

The products of the cult Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs have halved in price since April. Moonbirds dropped from $110,000 in April to $45,000 in May. The Reese Witherspoon-supported World of Women's project fell from $34,000 to $10,000.

Perhaps the most dramatic story happened with the image of CryptoPunks from Larva Labs. Seven months ago, the buyer paid for CryptoPunk number 273 for about 265 ETH, which at that time was about $1.272 million. In May, the same NFT was sold for only 55 ETH, or $132 thousand at the current rate.

Sina Estavi, a top manager at the Malaysian blockchain company Bridge Oracle, was also very unlucky. In March 2021, he bought the first tweet in the history of the planet for $ 2.9 million from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey NFT, and this year he put it up for auction and [could not sell](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jack-dorsey-tweet-nft-once-sold-for-2-9-million-now-might-fetch-under-14-000-11650110402?mod=article_inline) it at all . No potential buyer was willing to offer more than $14,000.

The desire to sell NFTs is understandable: the first buyers of tokens were able to make good money on their resale, crypto market researchers [found out](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/614cb06ad09e374be7d91eb9/t/61e4809284e7f61e90b4c543/1642365078757/1confirmation+2021+NFT+Year+in+Review.pdf) . They compiled the so-called [BLT index](https://www.bltindex.com/home) , which tracks market capitalization and dynamics. Its level has grown by 295% since 2018, despite a 50% drop since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, an index that tracks the performance of the most expensive NFT collections has surged 1,700% over the same period.

The problems in the NFT market are fraught with similar difficulties in cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin has fallen below $28,000 for the first time since 2020, and the largest stablecoins (pegged to real currencies) are experiencing the worst week in their history. Bitcoin is down 43% since last November, while the tech-related Nasdaq Composite is down 23%. The New York Times [notes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/technology/bitcoin-price-crashing-stocks.html) that "Bitcoin is doing more and more like the paper of an ordinary IT corporation."

The WSJ links the catastrophic processes in the token market with the growth of key rates and the curtailment of programs to support the population. Rising rates have called into question all risky assets in the financial markets of the world, including crypto, and the shortage of free money among the population has reduced their activity on crypto exchanges. Bitcoin is no longer considered “digital gold” and an asset that can protect savings from rising inflation. Yahoo Finance [points](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-bitcoin-inflation-hedge-231009445.html#:~:text=Bitcoin%20is%20often%20touted%20by,supply%20of%2021%20million%20units.) out that since the beginning of the year, cryptocurrencies have almost completely repeated the dynamics of the main US stock indices: a 4% decline in bitcoin coincided with a similar decrease in the S&P 500 index, and Ethereum (-8%) indicators turned out to be like two drops of water similar to those of Nasdaq .

Who is easy
-----------

CNET columnist Daniel van Boom [believes](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/are-nfts-dead-dont-count-on-it/) that rumors of the death of non-fungible tokens are greatly exaggerated. “Yes, NFT is not easy right now. But who is it easy now? ”He says and recalls that NFT as a technology is barely four years old, and it gained relatively wide popularity only last year and only among crypto enthusiasts.

“Volatility is especially inherent in NFTs because it is an immature market and, as a result, more susceptible to changes in user sentiment,” said Daniel Eitan McMahon, an economist at analytics firm Chainalysis.

At the same time, Daniel notes that NFT as a phenomenon has many ill-wishers: NFTs cost the planet dearly in terms of ecology and are often questionable from the point of view of art lovers, even the most modern ones. Not surprisingly, every drawdown in this volatile emerging market will cause the public to gloat.

Fortune [proposes to](https://fortune.com/2022/05/05/nft-market-sales-not-flatlining-data-shows/) compare the NFT market of the beginning of 2022 not with the last quarter of 2021 (if compared in this way, it is obvious that the market has really cooled down), but with the beginning of 2021. Then it turns out that the results of the digital asset are encouraging.

Corporations
------------

Despite unfavorable market conditions, American corporations and large investors have not lost their interest in NFTs. So, for example, Meta [stated](https://forklog.com/v-instagram-raskryli-podrobnosti-testirovaniya-podderzhki-nft/) that Instagram is enabling the ability to show an NFT image as an avatar, and in the future all social networks of the corporation will acquire additional crypto functionality. Madonna is launching her own NFTs in collaboration with [Beeple](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2022/05/10/material-girl-in-the-metaversemadonna-and-beeple-team-up-on-an-nft-triptych). Three tokens called Mother of Creation are being offered for sale with a starting price of $1 each. More real value than Dorsey's tweet.

In turn, the OpenSea platform, having suffered great reputational losses in the fake token scandal, [turned on](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23067192/opensea-nfts-copying-plagiarism-copymint-verification-bayc) the authentication system and, in general, began to pay more attention to security.

Since the beginning of 2022, the market for non-fungible tokens has already experienced ups and downs. In mid-February, the volume of transactions per week reached $3.9 billion, in mid-March it was reduced to $964 million per week. In April, there was a noticeable recovery in the market, followed by another collapse, [writes](https://www.financialexpress.com/digital-currency/the-growth-of-nft-transactions-continued-in-2022-which-started-in-2021-blog/2522107/) Financial Express

A drop in activity in the NFT market could be a great opportunity to stock up on them. The Financial Times, citing sources familiar with the deals, [claims](https://www.ft.com/content/de268ae5-8ee2-472e-a49b-243e63e7ef5c) that the two largest crypto investment funds, Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm, are not investing in projects that service or issue NFTs, but directly in digital works of art. Experts note that the funds are betting that the value of the NFTs they purchase will increase many times over as more and more people spend time in the so-called “new version of the Internet” created on the basis of cryptocurrencies - Web 3.0.
