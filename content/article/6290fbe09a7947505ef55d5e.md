Why are rare earth metals important?
------------------------------------

Rare earth metals are raw materials for the economy of the future. They are needed in high-tech production, for electric vehicles and in the creation of equipment for alternative energy. In 2021, the rare earths market was valued at $5.6 billion, and Research and Markets [estimates](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/26/2286847/28124/en/Global-Rare-Earth-Metals-Market-Research-Report-2021-to-2026-by-Application-and-Region.html) that it will reach $10.5 billion by 2026, with an average annual growth of 13.31%.

The leader in the world market of rare earth metals is China, which mines and [supplies](https://mnr.gov.ru/docs/gosudarstvennye_doklady/gosudarstvennyy_doklad_o_sostoyanii_i_ispolzovanii_mineralno_syrevykh_resursov_2020/) both raw materials and finished products. There are more than 200 such enterprises in the country. At the end of 2020, the share of China in the world reserves of REM was 35.5%, the share of production was 58%.

In second place in terms of production in the world is the United States (15.8%), Myanmar is third (12.5%), Australia is fourth (5.8%), Madagascar is fifth (3.3%), sixth - India (1.3%), seventh - Russia (1.1%).

Russia has a large share of reserves (15.6%), but there is no modern production for the extraction of rare earth metals. The only deposit under development (Lovozerskoye in the Murmansk region) contains mainly lanthanides of the cerium group.

“The development of other well-known facilities is hampered by the lack of effective industrial facilities for processing ores and concentrates in Russia, low domestic demand and high competition from China, which dominates the world REM market,” the [report](https://mnr.gov.ru/docs/gosudarstvennye_doklady/gosudarstvennyy_doklad_o_sostoyanii_i_ispolzovanii_mineralno_syrevykh_resursov_2020/) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Rosnedra says. As a result, domestic consumption in the country is fully provided by “forced imports”.

In addition, almost all Russian mining comes from apatite-nepheline ores, from which rare earth metals are not currently commercially extracted.

The rare earth metals (Rare earth metals) include a group of 17 elements: lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium (almost not found in nature), samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium , as well as yttrium and scandium.

In nature, rare earth metals often occur together in the form of compounds. All of these elements are silvery-white metals with similar chemical properties. After extraction from the mines, rare earth elements are sent to separation plants, where they are separated from other minerals. Then, oxides, metals and magnets are obtained separately from the raw materials.

Despite the fact that rare earth metals are needed for green energy technologies, their extraction is not always environmentally friendly. Many rare earth elements [are found](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/17/the-new-us-plan-to-rival-chinas-dominance-in-rare-earth-metals.html) among mineral deposits with radioactive substances.

Where rare earth metals are used
--------------------------------

REMs are used in a variety of industries, including electronics, aerospace, automotive and military equipment - elements are [needed](https://geology.com/articles/rare-earth-elements/) for night vision goggles, high-precision weapons, communications equipment, GPS equipment, batteries and other defense electronics. Many rare earth metals are used in the production of permanent magnets - in 2020, this segment [accounted for](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/minerals-mining/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts/20522) 29% of the total demand for REM.

Permanent magnets are an important component of modern electronics used in the manufacture of cell phones, televisions, computers, automobiles, wind turbines, jet aircraft and many other devices.

Rare earth metals are actively used in [complex](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/minerals-mining/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts/20522) technological devices, as well as for the needs of "green" technologies.

In many cars, rare earth metals [are installed](https://geology.com/articles/rare-earth-elements/) in exhaust systems to control air pollution.

Glass, granite, marble and gemstones are often [polished](https://geology.com/articles/rare-earth-elements/) with cerium oxide powder. Many motors and generators contain magnets made from rare earth elements.

Demand for rare earths will [increase](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/mineral-requirements-for-clean-energy-transitions) over time as they are critical to the production of wind turbines, electric vehicles and batteries, according to the International Energy Agency.

If the world moves to a sustainable economy model, by 2040 the total demand for minerals used in green technologies will [increase](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/mineral-requirements-for-clean-energy-transitions) four times.

What's Happening in the Rare Earth Market
-----------------------------------------

The main players in the global REM market are the USA and China, between which there is a [main struggle](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/17/the-new-us-plan-to-rival-chinas-dominance-in-rare-earth-metals.html) for raw materials and dominance in production. The undisputed leader is China, which has the largest reserves and produces a lot, and remains the largest consumer of REM. The country uses rare earth elements in the manufacture of electronics for domestic and foreign markets.

Until the 1980s, the US was the market leader. The PRC began producing rare earth oxides in large volumes in the early 1980s, becoming the world's leading producer in the early 1990s. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, China [strengthened](https://geology.com/articles/rare-earth-elements/) its position in the world market for rare earth oxides. The country sold them so cheaply that many mines around the world went bankrupt and stopped working. By 2010, China controlled about 95% of the world's production of rare earths. Taking advantage of its position, China periodically imposes restrictions [on the export of raw materials](https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1613842/china-crack-down-rare-earth-metal-exports-tightening-supplies-west-russia-ukraine) , which affects prices.

The United States has lost its strong position in this market due to the transfer of many world productions to China and the strengthening of environmental requirements in the country.

Now the United States is seriously involved in the [competition](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/17/the-new-us-plan-to-rival-chinas-dominance-in-rare-earth-metals.html) in this market with China, since for America REM is one of the priority areas in the supply chains of raw materials. Rare earth metals are important to the country due to the new climate and technology agenda as part of the US infrastructure plan.

The success of the US will depend on how quickly the country can increase processing and compete with Chinese producers on prices. However, experts believe that it could [take](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/17/the-new-us-plan-to-rival-chinas-dominance-in-rare-earth-metals.html) decades for the United States to constantly accelerate production to catch up with China.

**How rare are rare earth metals in nature?**

Thulium and lutetium are quite [common](https://geology.com/articles/rare-earth-elements/) rare earth elements, the average content of each of them in the earth's crust is almost 200 times higher than the content of gold. However, it is much more difficult to get them.

The most common rare earth metals are cerium, yttrium, lanthanum and neodymium. Their content in the earth's crust is similar in volume to such metals as chromium, nickel, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten and lead.

---------------------------------------------

Among the large companies that mine rare earth metals outside of China, enterprises from the USA, Canada and Australia are MP Materials, Materion Corporation, Lynas Rare Earths, Iluka Resources. In Russia, REM is mined by the Solikamsk magnesium plant.

[The Chinese authorities support](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/rare-earth-elements-where-in-the-world-are-they/) only six state-owned companies with production quotas :

1.  China Minmetals Rare Earth
2.  Chinalco Rare Earth & Metals
3.  Guangdong Rising Nonferrous
4.  China Northern Rare Earth Group
5.  China Southern Rare Earth Group
6.  Xiamen Tungsten

**MP Materials**

The American company MP Materials (ticker MP) [is engaged](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MP/) in the extraction and processing of rare earth metals. It went public in November 2020 through a merger with SPAC. Owns and operates the Mountain Pass mine, which has closed several times due to Chinese competition. The company mines elements such as cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium and samarium.

Shares in the American company are owned by the Chinese Shenghe Resources, which sells MP Materials products to the Asian market. At the same time, the company is viewed by US authorities as a major market player that will help the country reduce dependence on Chinese suppliers. It receives grants from the government of the country, develops an existing mine, and is also [implementing](https://www.fool.com/investing/06.04.2022/3-top-us-stocks-to-watch-in-april/) a new project for the production of Stage III magnets.

The company has growth drivers in the form of government support fighting China's market dominance, prospects for raw material supplies by companies under the US infrastructure plan, and long-term demand for REMs from the green energy and electric vehicle sectors.

Materion Corporation
--------------------

Founded in 1931 and until 2011 was called Brush Engineered Materials. The company manufactures beryllium-based components for the semiconductor, industrial, aerospace and defense industries, automotive, electronics, telecommunications and data centers.

In the first quarter of the year, the company was able to [increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/materion-mtrn-tops-q1-earnings-125512953.html) profit by 14.29%, which exceeded analysts' expectations. First-quarter operating income was $19.6 million and net income was $14.0 million, or $0.68 per diluted share.

In response to continued strong market demand, Materion Corporation [raised](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/materion-corporation-reports-record-quarterly-113000429.html) its 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.50 to $5.90.

The company will also be the beneficiary of the US infrastructure upgrade and the long-term green energy transition trend.
