Five years ago, the total value of all digital assets on Earth was $14 billion. Last November, according [to](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-innovation-in-digital-assets/) the White House, it exceeded $3 trillion, and the question of what to do with such a huge market has become one of the central questions in the global economy.

The governments of an increasing number of countries are “turning their faces” towards the crypto world, [writes](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/15/pbws-crypto-bosses-say-the-tide-is-turning-on-regulation.html) CNBC. The creator of the largest crypto exchange Binance, Changpeng CZ Zhao, at the Binance Blockchain Week conference in Paris, said that the tone of regulators in discussions of “crypto” has changed from negative to positive.

However, there is probably no general global trend in relation to the “crypto”. While many governments are looking for ways to profitably use blockchain and decentralized finance, the world's largest economies - in particular the United States and China - are still hostile to cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

Russia
------

In Russia, crypto is actively being looked at as a way to circumvent sanctions. The Ministry of Finance has prepared a draft law on the comprehensive regulation of the cryptocurrency market, including the procedure for conducting transactions with digital currencies and issuing them. Anatoly Aksakov, head of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, says that before the end of the spring session, it is planned to amend the Tax Code to recognize cryptocurrencies as property and tax them, Kommersant [writes .](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5296000)

At the same time, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, [speaking](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5295537) in the State Duma, stressed that the government and the Central Bank of Russia oppose the recognition of cryptocurrency as a means of payment. The Central Bank previously indicated that the recognition of cryptocurrencies could create conditions for the emergence of a new financial system parallel to the main one. However, Mishustin drew attention to the fact that, according to the government, more than 10 million Russians have crypto wallets, which contain more than 10 trillion rubles in total, so the government needs to “seriously discuss” the concept of handling them.

The transition of cryptocurrencies to the mainstream may be hampered by sanctions. For example, on April 21, the Binance exchange [announced](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/crypto-exchange-binance-limits-services-russia-after-eu-sanctions-2022-04-21/) that, in accordance with EU sanctions, it would restrict the access of users from the Russian Federation to its services. Starting from this date, individuals and legal entities with a balance on a crypto wallet of more than $10.9 thousand will not be able to make transactions. At the same time, Binance left the ability to withdraw funds, while other users were not affected by the restrictions.

New US sanctions have affected cryptocurrency miners. On April 20, the US Treasury for the first time in history [introduced](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/20/us-treasury-sanctions-russian-bitcoin-miners.html) restrictions on bitcoin mining in the Russian Federation. According to the University of Cambridge, today Russia ranks third in the world in terms of the total capacity of cryptocurrency mining devices.

The BitRiver company and ten of its subsidiaries in the territory of the Russian Federation fell under the influence of American sanctions. The company is engaged in large-scale mining of cryptocurrencies using the energy of hydroelectric power plants and other hydropower enterprises. “U.S. sanctions should obviously be seen as interference in the cryptocurrency industry, creating conditions for unfair competition and an attempt to increase the share of American companies in the market,” Igor Runets, founder and head of BitRiver, told CNBC. At the same time, according to the entrepreneur, his firm "has never worked with Russian government agencies or companies that have previously fallen under US sanctions." Earlier [, Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/) [associated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-24/seo-inside-russia-s-largest-bitcoin-mine) BitRiver with the structures of Oleg Deripaska. According [to](https://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/463303-pocemu-ssa-nalozili-sankcii-na-krupnejsuu-v-rossii-fermu-dla-majninga-kriptovalut)representative of the company, they had few customers from the USA and new ones have already taken their place.

USA
---

Last year, an important event took place in the United States - Biden's infrastructure bill was signed, which is designed to strengthen the country's economy as it emerges from the pandemic. However, Republican Patrick McHenry [drew](https://www.ft.com/content/29f32905-1933-458e-aa29-7f1685109ea1) attention to the threat to the crypto community contained in the 2700-page document. Namely, on the new norm: brokers trading in cryptocurrency will now be required to notify the tax authorities about transactions. The new rule is designed to stop tax evasion through the buying and selling of crypto assets, but there is a problem. The term "broker" in the document was used in such a broad sense that developers who issue their own tokens can fall under this rule.

Meanwhile, the “cryptolobby” in Congress is gaining momentum. It is made up, as the Financial Times describes it, of liberal free marketers, business lobbyists and left-wing utopians. His influence will only grow in the coming years.

But those who want to regulate everything and everything still have a lot of influence. US Congressman Michael McCall [urged](https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-urges-biden-administration-to-develop-robust-strategy-to-prevent-crypto-use-to-evade-sanctions/) President Biden to develop a tough strategy to prevent cryptocurrencies from being used to circumvent sanctions. After all, for example, in Russia a month ago , the possibility of selling oil and gas for bitcoins was discussed [.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/24/russia-might-take-bitcoin-as-payment-for-oil-and-gas-as-sanctions-rise.html)

[The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the co-founders of the blockchain firm Ripple](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/secret-service-seizes-102-million-crypto-assets-rcna24967) , Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, accusing them of illegally selling cryptocurrencies worth $1 billion. crypto for a total of $102 million.

At the same time, cryptocurrencies pegged to the dollar feel good. Circle, a USD-pegged USD Coin startup, has grown its capitalization by 370% over the past 12 months, to $50.8 billion. The startup recently raised another $400 million investment from BlackRock, Fidelity Management & Research, Marshall Wace and Fin capital. In addition, BlackRock has become a close partner of Circle.

“Dollar-based digital currencies like USDC are fueling a global economic transformation, and Circle is at the center of that change,” [said](https://www.barrons.com/articles/blackrock-stablecoin-operator-circle-internet-51649790453) Jeremy Allaire, CEO and co-founder of the company. The head of the US Treasury, Janet Yellen, [speaks](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/07/treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-calls-crypto-transformative-in-wide-ranging-speech/) cautiously on the topic of cryptocurrencies and digital currencies . According to her, “the digital dollar can become an authoritative means of payment comparable to cash,” and the development of legal regulations for such digital assets will be a priority for US lawmakers in the next couple of years.

UK and Europe
-------------

In mid-April, the British government announced that it intends to bring stablecoins into existing local regulations and thus reduce the number of gray areas. Also Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak [suggested](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23010457/uk-royal-mint-nft-her-majestys-treasury-crypto-regulation-legislation) issuing NFTs. The crypto industry in the country welcomes these decisions and [believes](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/19/uk-crypto-industry-hopes-for-more-clarity-from-planned-stablecoin-rules/) that in this way the UK has become one step closer to the development of full-fledged legislation that will regulate other operations with digital assets.

Favor for the "crypt" demonstrates France. The Binance exchange, which once boasted of its decentralization and the lack of a head office, nevertheless decided to start it - and it will be opened in Paris. The company's cooperation with the Station F business incubator will also begin here. Together they will launch an acceleration program in the field of cryptocurrencies and Web3.

However, not everyone on the continent believes that cryptocurrencies and digital assets can regulate themselves. On April 13, 40 representatives of the crypto industry [turned](https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-crypto-industry-steps-up-efforts-influence-eu-policy-2022-04-19/) to European officials with a request to soften the developed norms. In particular, to cancel the mandatory disclosure of transaction details and reduce regulatory pressure on decentralized financial platforms in the region. According to industry representatives, the rules, if approved, will cause irreparable damage to all owners of digital assets in the EU.

India and China
---------------

In India, cryptocurrencies are still treated with caution, but the local regulator has [begun](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/top-cryptocurrency-news-on-april-19-the-biggest-moves-in-bitcoin-policy-and-more-8366281.html) preparing to launch its own digital currency. The start is scheduled for 2023. Today, about 15 million people make transactions with digital assets in the country. The most popular currencies, as well as all over the world, are bitcoin and ether.

In China, crypto trading was taken out of the legal field in September 2021. Prior to this, China was the unspoken global leader in mining, but after the introduction of new restrictions, all farms located in the country that decided to stay switched to supporting allowed digital currencies.

Now, additional restrictions have been [imposed](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/13/chinas-banking-association-proposes-restrictions-on-nfts/) on NFTs: the China Banking, Securities and Internet Finance Association has reported that non-fungible tokens can only be used to confirm ownership of an object, but cannot be sold for cryptocurrency.
