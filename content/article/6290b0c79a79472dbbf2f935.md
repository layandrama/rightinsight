“When I came here, my eyes just popped out of my head - there is such beauty here, and here I don’t even know what to choose, where to sit, what to take. Well, in general, I'm happy, ”a young visitor to the first McDonald's restaurant in Moscow shared her impressions with a TV correspondent on January 30, 1990, on the opening day. Crowds inside, outside there is a gigantic line enveloping Pushkin Square.

The footage made the rounds in the media and social media after the company first announced a “suspension of activities” in Russia in early March of this year, and then finally exiting the market on May 16. For 32 years of operation, the chain has opened 850 restaurants. “The place of McDonald’s in Russia, of course, will not be taken by anyone, since no one in Russia has a similar complexity and system of business,” Mikhail Goncharov, the founder of Teremok, [wrote](https://vc.ru/opinions/379191-mesto-mcdonald-s-nikto-ne-zaymet-osnovatel-teremka-obyasnil-chto-zakrytie-restoranov-ne-pomozhet-mestnomu-biznesu) in a sensational post in response to those who saw him leaving company opportunities for domestic business. And, indeed, no matter how much criticism and problems McDonald's has faced throughout its long history, no other competing chain has yet managed to take the palm from it, and the brand [remains](https://www.marketingweek.com/mcdonalds-bigger-than-jesus-christ/) one of the most recognizable in the world. Here's how the company went from a small eatery in California to a giant corporation with 40,000 restaurants worldwide (as of March 2022) and annual revenues in excess of $23 billion.

The McDonald brothers conquer California
----------------------------------------

The path to success with Maurice and Richard Dick McDonald was not an easy one. The brothers were born in Manchester, New Hampshire, to poor Irish immigrant parents. Their father worked for 42 years at a shoe factory, after which he was simply fired because of his age - he was left without a job and without a pension. Maurice and Dick, who were most afraid of repeating his fate, promised each other that by the age of 50 they should become millionaires, and went to look for luck on the west coast.

Once in California, for some time the brothers worked in shifts at the film studio, and then the McDonalds, having saved up money, bought a cinema with 750 seats in the suburbs of Los Angeles. The year was 1930, and it was hard to imagine a more inopportune moment to start a business in the entertainment industry: the Great Depression was in full swing, and Americans were saving on everything. Having somehow managed to hold out for seven whole years, the brothers nevertheless closed the cinema, but did not give up and decided to try their hand at another area.

McDonald's [opened](https://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/mcdonald-brothers-open-restaurant-nh-shoe-factories-close/) hot dog stand under the Airdome sign in Monrovia, California. Later, hamburgers were added to the menu for 10 cents and orange juice for a cent a glass. Three years later, the business "moved" to the larger San Bernardino on the famous Highway 66 and changed its name to McDonald's Bar-B-Que. There were already 25 items on the menu. The diner began to enjoy great popularity, especially among drivers who do not want to spend a lot of time for lunch. After several years of successful operation, the brothers began to look for new opportunities for growth and ways to increase the speed of service. Then they read about the real estate developer William Levitt, who adopted Ford's assembly line principle: on the east coast, his mass development projects appeared like mushrooms after rain. The McDonalds decided they could do the same at their diner.

The brothers completely revised the process of work. After reviewing receipts, they narrowed down the menu to nine of their most popular items: there were several varieties of burgers, french fries, apple pie, milkshakes and soft drinks. All that remained was that which did not require a lot of time and any special skills from the cooks. Maurice and Dick broke the preparation of each dish into several stages and developed a kitchen layout so that employees could complete the order as quickly as possible. Where possible, the process was automated: a sauce filling machine and a milkshake blender were installed in the café. They decided to pack ready meals in plastic boxes and paper bags, getting rid of the need to wash the dishes (and at the same time from the employees who did it). The waitresses who took orders to the drivers were also fired. Now I had to go to the diner on my own. The waiting time and low prices quite brightened up this inconvenience: the order was prepared in just half a minute. At this time, the visitor could admire the well-coordinated and fast work of the chefs in the open, shining clean kitchen.

“Everything was mechanized,” [wrote](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/16/business/richard-mcdonald-89-fast-food-revolutionary.html) publicist and historian David Halberstam in his book The Fifties. “Most of the dishes were prepared in advance, the time between the busiest hours was used to prepare for the next influx of visitors.”

McDonald's (already without the obsolete Bar-B-Que) has become terribly popular among those who are always in a hurry and want to save money - schoolchildren, students, taxi drivers, travelers passing by. The McDonalds got rich - each bought a Cadillac and changed the car for every new year.

After some time, the brothers noticed that among the visitors began to appear those who were especially persistent in trying to find out the intricacies of the restaurant's workflow. On reflection, they decided that it was more profitable to start selling the concept, and not try to discourage plagiarists. So the McDonalds launched the franchise: the “recipe for success” cost $950.

{{< img src="XAjS9ii.jpg" width="900" height="600" caption="Photo: Tim Boyle/Getty Images" >}}

The brothers approached the opening of new restaurants seriously. They brought in architect Stanley Clark Meston, who came up with a red sign with white lettering and a trendy modern interior. Dick McDonald insisted that 7-meter yellow arches appear on the sides of the building - so the restaurant would be more visible to passing motorists. The locals didn't like them. “I stuck these damn things in there, but I didn’t tell anyone that I had anything to do with the project,” he later said. The brothers offered the architect a choice - either a one-time fixed fee, or a commission for the opening of each new restaurant. Meston chose the first and, obviously, made a big mistake. In 1953, a second McDonald's opened in Downey, California (it continues to operate to this day). The following year, [the network was](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/16/business/richard-mcdonald-89-fast-food-revolutionary.html) there are already nine own restaurants and 21 franchise outlets.

New "founder"
-------------

One person was particularly interested in the success of the network. Ray Kroc sold machines for milkshakes, but the trade was not very brisk. And there was only one major customer who was buying more and more - McDonald's. Intrigued, Kroc traveled to San Bernardino to see for himself what was so special about the chain's restaurants. The speed of service, cleanliness, friendly staff, organization of the work process shocked him - it was modern and unusual. And most importantly, relatively few resources were required to open and maintain a diner. Kroc quickly realized that the potential for an innovative concept was enormous. He met with the McDonalds, but they told him that the current pace of business development suits them perfectly and they have no desire to create a network of a national scale. Then Krok offered to take this task upon himself. The McDonalds agreed.

{{< img src="KtSIoQz.jpg" width="900" height="600" caption="Photo: AP" >}}

Under the terms of the deal, Kroc had the right to sell the McDonald's franchise and received 1.9% of each new outlet's sales. At the same time, he gave 1% to McDonalds. In the first year, Kroc opened 18 restaurants, but earned almost nothing from this. Then the resourceful entrepreneur went for a trick: he began to lease the land on which new points of the network were built on a long-term lease. The franchisee paid either a fixed rent or a percentage of sales, depending on which amount was higher at the end of the month. With a relatively small investment, the franchisee essentially received a ready-made, proven business model. The company is paying back and rapidly scaling. Everyone was a winner. Kroc opened 228 McDonald's restaurants by 1960, generating $56 million in revenue.

{{< ads >}}

However, he still continued to pay a percentage of McDonalds, and relations with them did not go well: Kroc had his own vision for the further development of the network, but the brothers prevented any changes. As a result, he once simply called the McDonalds with an offer to buy the company from them. They named a price. “I dropped the phone on the floor first, and then the jaw,” Krok later recalled. \- They asked what kind of strange sounds I had in the receiver, and I answered that I was flying from the 20th floor of the LaSalle Walker skyscraper \[in Chicago\]. They demanded $2.7 million.” The entrepreneur had to borrow money at a high interest rate, and in the end the deal cost him $ 14 million - Krok hated the brothers. “I think there was no other choice. I wanted the name of the McDonalds and their golden arches. With the surname "Krok" you will not go far, ”he said later.

At the same time, the McDonalds refused to sell him the first restaurant in San Bernardino, which Kroc was especially fond of. The brothers were forced to change his name to The Big M, as they lost the right to use their own name. Kroc found a way to get revenge: he opened a new McDonald's cafe a couple of hundred meters away. Unable to withstand the competition, the brothers were soon forced to close The Big M. And, of course, a few years later they realized how cheap they were. The bitterness was added by the fact that after buying the network, Kroc did everything to make the McDonald brothers forgotten, and called himself the founder of the company. “Up until the moment of the sale, there was no word that he was the founder,” [said](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/16/business/richard-mcdonald-89-fast-food-revolutionary.html) Dick MacDonald in a 1991 interview. “Had he mentioned it then, he would have gone back to selling milkshake blenders.”

Entertaining "hamburgerology"
-----------------------------

Having gained control of the company, Kroc finally felt free. First of all, he decided to update the design of the network. First, Kroc got rid of the company's first mascot, a cook named Speedy, who adorned the logo. He wanted to remove the "golden arches" as well. He was dissuaded by Louis Cheskin, hired by Kroc as a consulting designer. In the imagination of Cheskin, who was seriously fond of Freudianism, the architecture of restaurants was curiously [intertwined](https://qz.com/745681/the-strange-freudian-design-of-mcdonalds-golden-arches/) with the ideas of the "father of psychoanalysis". The arches turned into a new logo, a large yellow "M" - according to the designer, at the unconscious level, it was supposed to evoke an association with "Mother McDonald's breasts" and thus attract visitors to restaurants. It is not known for certain what role Freud's theory ultimately played in the popularity of McDonald's, but the logo remains one of the most recognizable in the world to this day. Also two years later, the famous mascot of the company appeared - the clown Ronald McDonald.

{{< img src="RxD8vCP.jpg" width="900" height="600" caption="Photo: Mario Tama / Getty Images" >}}

The principle of the Ford conveyor, adopted by the McDonalds, was elevated by Krok to an absolute. He compiled a 75-page instruction for employees, in which absolutely all work processes were described in detail. Exclusion of any opportunities for improvisation allowed, on the one hand, to reduce the time for staff training, and on the other hand, to achieve stable quality and results across the entire network. All restaurants had the same burgers, whether it was McDonald's in Texas or Michigan. Customers liked this predictability - when they were away from home, they went to McDonald's because they knew what to expect. 1961 also saw the opening of the company's first corporate training facility, called "Hamburger University" in Oak Brook, Illinois, for employees and prospective franchisees.

The franchise model allowed the company not only to grow rapidly, but also to expand the range. The menu of the network remained unchanged for a long time, but the changes began in 1962. Restaurant owner in Cincinnati, Ohio, Lou Groen [noticed](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-fishy-history-of-the-mcdonalds-filet-o-fish-sandwich-2912/) that burgers sold poorly on Fridays: Catholics, who made up 87% of the city's population, did not eat meat that day. Then Groen came up with a fishcake burger. Kroc allowed him to test the idea in his restaurant, and the new burger quickly became very popular - this is how the famous Filet-O-Fish appeared on the chain's menu. Subsequently, the management of the network encouraged such experiments by franchisees: what became successful at the local level was introduced into the assortment of McDonald's. It was much cheaper and faster than if the company tried to develop new dishes on its own and test them on a network scale. Classic hits like chicken nuggets or the Big Mac owe the chain to the ingenuity of its franchisees.

In those years, McDonald's positioned itself as a place where families and children would be comfortable. Representatives of the company told the press that the locations for new restaurants were chosen based on the number of churches, schools and the number of private houses. Kroc, among other things, forbade placing in restaurants and next to them automatic music players, cigarette machines and telephone booths - characteristic signs of a typical American diner of those years. According to the entrepreneur, they attracted a "suspicious public" and thus scared away the target audience. Of course, prices also played a huge role: in the mid-1960s, a lunch at McDonald's, consisting of a burger, a serving of fries and a milkshake, would cost only 45 cents - a huge deal if you need to feed a large family.

An important element of McDonald's promotional strategy was statistics. Near the restaurants there were large boards that reported how many hamburgers were sold, and company representatives proudly talked about the achievements of the network to the press. So, in 1966, a cafe in Kingsport [reported](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fYZTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XIYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6618%2C2153374) that it had sold 3.2 million hamburgers in four years of operation. At the same time, visitors in the age group from 7 to 13 years old ate an average of 6.2 hamburgers per week (at that time no one thought about how useful such a diet was). Visual evidence of wild popularity only helped to increase it.

{{< ads >}}

In total, the chain's chefs by that time had prepared 2 billion hamburgers, and the number of restaurants reached 750. A year earlier, McDonald's held an IPO and thus became the first public company in the fast food segment. In 1967, a McDonald's restaurant opened in Richmond, Canada, and then in Costa Rica. The next decade was marked by a massive international expansion. Only in 1971 did the network "come" to Japan, the Netherlands and Australia. However, abroad, at first, not everything went smoothly - in 1972, a loss in Europe amounted to $ 1 million. McDonald's followed a long-tested strategy and, like in the United States, opened new outlets in the suburbs. However, their inhabitants, in contrast to the inhabitants of the prosperous American suburbia, did not show sufficient interest in the overseas novelty: differences in the urban structure and in the culture of leisure affected. Then the company began opening restaurants in urban centers, counting on the interest of American tourists and curious locals, after which things went smoothly. “Here you have to try new things. So I tried the Big Mac[](http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,907911-9,00.html) an American tourist in Paris told Time [.](http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,907911-9,00.html) In 1973, the company [announced](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/mcdonalds-burger-king-brand-rivalry-burger-wars/621713/) that sales had reached $1 billion for the first time, and by 1974, the number of outlets had reached 3,000 (an "anniversary" restaurant opened in London).

Three years later, Kroc stepped down as CEO and was replaced by Fred Turner, a company veteran and living embodiment of the American Dream: in 1956, the future CEO fried burger patties at a McDonald's in Des Plaines, Illinois. Under his leadership, the company began to introduce new restaurant formats and menu items to keep a potential audience against the backdrop of growing competition. There were cafes for drivers, where you could make and pick up an order without leaving the car, ready-made Happy Meal sets with toys were introduced to the menu for children, and in 1977, breakfasts appeared in the restaurants of the network for those who are always in a hurry.

Tired Titan
-----------

By the end of the decade, the company's annual revenue [was](https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/24/archives/market-place-mixed-views-on-mcdonalds.html) already $ 2 billion, and the number of restaurants exceeded 5 thousand. In addition to the United States, McDonald's could be found in 23 other countries. And, although experts noted great opportunities for further international expansion, the reason for criticism and fears was the "clumsiness" of the network, which offered not so many new products and whose menu was not as diverse as smaller competitors - Burger King and Wendy's.

The companies themselves also perfectly understood what their advantage was, and did not fail to take advantage of it. In the 1980s, McDonald's not only grew rapidly abroad (the number of restaurants [increased](https://www.deseret.com/1990/1/28/18843715/80s-were-a-golden-decade-for-mcdonald-s-br-company-posts-earnings-of-727-million-for-1989) by almost 5.5 thousand), but also became embroiled in a "burger war": throughout the decade, Burger King, Wendy's and McDonald's waged extremely aggressive advertising campaigns. against a friend. It all started in 1982 when Burger King released a commercial claiming that the burgers in the chain had 20% more patties than McDonald's. The latter did not remain in debt and simply filed a lawsuit against a competitor. The "picking" continued in subsequent marketing campaigns, on which firms spent fabulous budgets, often to their own detriment.

{{< ads >}}

So, McDonald's even introduced a new McDLT burger, which spent about $100 million on advertising. The novelty was not successful and was quickly withdrawn from the menu. And in 1984, the company launched perhaps its most controversial marketing campaign ever: Before the start of the Los Angeles Summer Olympics, McDonald's promised that it would give away free Big Macs, French fries, and soda every time U.S. athletes won medals. The problem was that the USSR and the countries of the social bloc boycotted those games and American athletes, left without their main rivals, won medals non-stop. The “attraction of unprecedented generosity” attracted so many visitors that as a result, some restaurants simply ran out of burger buns. “With all these gold medals for the American team, we are just sewn up ... This is the most successful, but also McDonald's most expensive marketing campaign."[said](https://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-sp-mcdonalds-olympics-20170616-story.html) a company representative.

Companies overly concerned with fighting each other and conquering new markets have not paid due attention to new rivals. Driver-only burger chains emerged, a format that kept operating costs, and therefore the cost of food, lower than industry titans like McDonald's. And in 1988, the Taco Bell Mexican eatery chain [introduced](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/19/magazine/steal-this-burger.html?pagewanted=print)a taco costing just 59 cents, and its sales soared 16%. In 1992, finally realizing the potential threat, McDonald's first introduced the "combo": a ready-made set of several items, such as a cheeseburger, a serving of french fries and a bottle of soda. "Combo" was cheaper than if the visitor bought the same dishes separately. "It's a brilliant strategy because it both benefits the customer and helps increase the company's bottom line by growing sales of soda and French fries," Janice Meyer, an analyst at investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, explained.

By that time, McDonald's had become for the whole world a synonym for the very concept of "fast food" and one of the symbols of American culture in general. This happened due to the fact that in most countries the network came before competitors. However, the glory of the innovator remained far in the past, and the fast food market in the United States was oversaturated. Other formats became more and more popular: pizzerias, Mexican eateries, and especially coffee houses - it was in the 1990s that Starbucks skyrocketed.

McDonald's, on the other hand, has never been particularly inventive in terms of assortment development, began a losing streak. The company was losing market share and tried to save the day with new menu items. However, attempts to sell pizza were unsuccessful. In 1996, the chain introduced another Arch Deluxe burger worth $2.29, which, according to experts, spent about $300 million to develop and advertise. Buyers did not appreciate the effort: the novelty was not popular, and two years later it disappeared from the menu of the vast majority of restaurants networks. In the same year, McDonald's launched the "55 Campaign" promotion, in which the cost of the most popular burgers was reduced to 55 cents. But only on the condition that the visitor buys soda and french fries with them, which in the end was slightly cheaper than the usual “combo”. The campaign, which caused bewilderment of the audience, had to be curtailed two months after the launch. McDonald's has been testing new products endlessly, but almost none of the experiments have led to success.

Unable to grow its audience with a varied and interesting menu, McDonald's focused on further growth of the chain, hoping to attract new customers. The result turned out to be paradoxical: in the late 1990s, there were so many restaurants in the United States that new outlets began [to “take away”](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/05/business/mcdonald-s-seeks-a-plan-for-the-90-s.html) customers from old ones - franchisees, dissatisfied with the situation, even began to file lawsuits against the chain.

Among other things, the company faced serious reputational problems. In the United States and around the world, people began to pay more attention to their health, exercise and monitor nutrition. Food from McDonald's was hard to call "healthy". More and more questions were also raised by the treatment of employees who received monstrously low salaries for exhausting work. A lot of hype was caused by the book published in 2001 by investigative journalist Eric Schlosser "Fast Food Nation", where he criticized the entire industry and McDonald's in particular. A wave of documentaries and publications followed, focusing on the company's questionable practices and the health effects of fast food.

{{< ads >}}

All this could not but affect the financial results. In the last quarter of 2002, the company reported a drop in sales for the first time in its history and, as a result, a loss of $343.8 million. “For decades, McDonald's has remained unrivaled,” [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/) Businessweek [wrote](http://large.stanford.edu/publications/coal/references/golgoi/) in 2003. The company became the first place of work for millions of Americans and changed the diet of the entire nation. From a small diner in a suburb of Chicago, she has become an icon of American culture. But today it is an unbalanced giant, unable to get out of trouble.

The company needed to be rescued urgently. Jack Greenberg, who ran McDonald's from 1999 to 2002, was replaced by James Cantalupo. He in turn hired former consultant Larry Light as CMO, and together they devised a strategy to modernize the chain and its brand.

They set a new goal: not to increase the number of new points, but to attract more customers to existing ones (the growth rate of the chain slowed down sharply - if in 2002 1 thousand McDonald's restaurants were [opened](https://www.forbes.com/2004/12/09/cx_pp_1209overachiever.html?sh=1f3d773a179f) worldwide, then in 2003 - only 300). The menu now includes items designed for those who follow the diet - salads and chicken dishes. Dark chicken meat, which is more high-calorie and fatty than white meat, was no longer added to nuggets, and an egg and bacon sandwich appeared on the breakfast menu. As a result, the average check increased by 4%. Also in 2002, the company launched the McCafé chain of coffee shops, which allowed it to compete with Starbucks. The concept was invented by the Australian branch of the company back in 1993 and was even more popular there than the "regular" restaurants of the chain.

Light said later that it was important for McDonald's to develop regional initiatives. This helped to solve an important image problem - to get rid of an overly "Americanized" image, but at the same time to create a single global brand, interesting and close to the people of different countries. “We have adopted the interior design created in France. McCafé originated in Australia. The packaging was redesigned in Birmingham, England,” Light [listed.](https://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/brand-relevance-the-strategy-behind-mcdonalds-im-lovin-it/)

In turn, a small marketing agency from the suburbs of Munich came up with the longest-running advertising slogan in the company's history - I'm Lovin' It ("That's what I love"). The management of McDonald's liked the idea, and in 2003 a new commercial was released: skaters, cyclists, surfers, musicians and office workers have fun, chat and, of course, eat McDonald's burgers, while Justin Timberlake, terribly popular in those years, sings I'm Lovin ' It under, perhaps, one of the most famous jingles in the world (the same "para-pa-pa-pam"). The advertisement was clearly designed for a young audience and was designed to “rejuvenate” the company itself. What she succeeded in, buyers quickly fell in love with the updated image. “Traditionally, McDonald's has spoken to customers from a McDonald's perspective. You'll love it." It is not right, Light explained. \- We called the new intonation of McDonald's "I-voice". We stopped telling customers how they feel and instead let us tell us what they think \[of the company\]."

{{< img src="yUGveF3.jpg" width="900" height="600" caption="Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" >}}

Changes helped to achieve the desired goal. In 2003, sales [grew](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000119312505042609/d10k.htm) by 2.4%, in 2004 - by another 6.9%. Revenue for the same year increased by 7%, reaching a record $19 billion. Profit for 2003 was $1.47 billion, and for 2004 - already $2.28 billion.

New challenges
--------------

Financial indicators continued to grow for several more years - it seemed that the strategy was working. However, in 2012 there were signs of a new crisis. In October of that year, the chain's sales fell 1.8% for the first time since 2003. Moreover, the sales structure was now dominated by Europe, not the US. In 2013–2015, the negative dynamics only intensified. Competition in the American market by that time had noticeably intensified again. On the one hand, "perpetual adversaries" McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's, as well as Taco Bell, have begun to gain market share through lower prices, inventive and aggressive advertising, and successful menu updates. On the other hand, chain restaurants of the fast casual segment (Chipotle, Five Guys, Shake Shack and others) became more and more popular.

{{< ads >}}

It turned out that one McDonald's lost in price, others - in assortment. Trying to cope with the problems, the company both increased its menu and tried to introduce a customization option for some dishes. However, the novelties did not have much success, and the approaches contradicted each other. “You have a lot more personalization if your menu has three items, not 20. You can’t significantly add and change anything if you already have 20 different dishes,” [explained](https://www.livemint.com/Companies/BBliTrueRaJX6G3ix9fP3K/McDonalds-sales-drop-for-first-time-since-2003.html) Andrew Alvarez, an analyst at the research company IBISWorld. In addition, in 2014, McDonald's removed the "$1 menu" with the cheapest items in the hope of increasing margins, but this only exacerbated the fall in sales.

Among other things, the popularity of the network was not added by numerous scandals related to both the quality of products (for example, in 2012, the ABC TV channel showed a report from a factory that produced minced meat scraps for fast food restaurants, including McDonald's, which in the media and social networks dubbed "pink goo"), and with the rights of employees. In various US cities, McDonald's workers went out to protest, demanding higher hourly rates and reduced shifts, the duration of which in some cases [reached](https://www.mashed.com/134913/the-biggest-scandals-to-ever-plague-mcdonalds/) 25 hours. “Wages have stopped rising, income inequality has skyrocketed, and shifts at McDonald’s, once the first job for aspiring teenagers, have now become low-paying part-time jobs for adults,” [wrote](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/ray-kroc-mcdonalds-america/514538/) edition of The Atlantic.


Then the company took up the refinement of the range. First, McDonald's got rid of unpopular positions, leaving the main "hits". And in the fall of 2015, the breakfast menu, previously only valid until 10:30 am, became available all day - the opportunity to buy such popular dishes as, for example, McMuffin with egg, delighted customers and led to an [increase in sales](https://www.nrn.com/power-list-2016-no-2-Steve-Easterbrook) in the last quarter of the year. In 2016, the McPick 2 menu appeared: the visitor could choose two items from those offered at a reduced price. Finally, in 2017, new espresso-based drinks appeared - another (and quite successful) attempt to compete with coffee houses.

In 2017, the network began to master new technologies. McDonald's made its own mobile application, in which users could place and pay for the order, and then pick it up at the nearest restaurant. At the same time, the long-awaited delivery appeared (first in the United States, and then in other countries) and sensory kiosks in restaurants, with the help of which visitors could independently choose and pay for dishes.

Finally, the network has rebranded. The packaging in bright colors, mainly in the brand's combination of yellow and red, was replaced with a new one made from recycled cardboard. The company moved away from the color scheme, which (largely through the efforts of McDonald's itself) was associated by consumers with fast food, high-calorie and "unhealthy" food.

The new course helped significantly improve the position of the company. Revenue [fell](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/05/14/whats-mcdonalds-doing-right-that-its-stock-went-up-a-massive-75-between-2016-and-2019-while-revenue-fell/?sh=5dc99a4da0d9) 14.4% between 2016 and 2019, but net margins rose 50%, largely due to an increase in the share of franchised restaurants from 82% to 93%. The stock eventually soared 74.9% over the same period.

The COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2020 was a serious test for the network - due to lockdowns in Europe and the United States, profits [decreased](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MCD/mcdonalds/net-income) by 21.5% compared to the previous year. But a stable financial position and a large amount of cash on the balance sheet helped McDonald's overcome difficulties: the company has actively invested in the development of formats available to quarantined customers - a chain of restaurants for drivers and delivery (especially in Europe, where cafes for motorists are less in demand) . Already in July 2021, the chain launched the long-awaited McDonald's Rewards loyalty program, the number of participants in which by October [reached](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/mcdonalds-gets-some-early-results-its-loyalty-program) 21 million. Having limited the menu at the beginning of the pandemic due to a shortage of employees and falling demand, in 2021 the company also began to add new items to the menu - several chicken sandwiches and its first "vegan" burger with plant-based meat patty. And to top it all off, the network has continued to add temporary combos to the menu, made with showbiz stars ranging from American singer Mariah Carey to K-pop group BTS. Efforts were not in vain: revenue in 2021 grew by 21%, to $23 billion, profit — by 59%, to $7.5 billion.

Of course, things are not going smoothly for the company even now. Inflation forced McDonald's to raise prices. Like many other corporations, the chain faced a shortage of workers. However, in this case, digitalization came to the rescue - a mobile application and the ability to place an order in a restaurant on your own allows you to cope with orders even with a smaller staff. The company's risks in connection with a possible recession do not scare analysts too much. McDonald's has an impressive financial "airbag" and one of the most recognizable brands in the world - this "asset" will continue to attract buyers in a crisis. “We're not in the hamburger business. We're in show business," Ray Kroc once said. And in many ways he turned out to be right: McDonald's has long been selling not just food, but a certain experience and a set of associations. And it's unlikely to be replaced.
