**Bill Gates**

The Microsoft founder believes that the ability of a company to adequately respond to unplanned events, good or bad, is a strong competitive advantage. According to Gates, it is important that people know the bad news and have the opportunity to openly express their opinions and show their attitude towards them. And it depends on how the leader behaves. “Changing the norm of employee behavior, encouragement and the ability to listen to bad news must come from above,” Gates is sure.

He also encourages leaders in times of uncertainty and crisis to try not to make commitments that they may not be able to fulfill in the future due to great uncertainty. "I think it's important not to over-promise, because that's not very effective," Gates said.

The billionaire gives some more advice on how leaders should behave during difficult times:

*   take the lead in creating an environment conducive to open discussion of issues;
*   accept failure and allow employees to experiment;
*   listen to bad news to find out what needs to be improved;
*   deliver bad news immediately;
*   make informed decisions based on reliable data;
*   give subordinates the freedom to work quickly on solutions.

**Jeff Bezos**

The founder of Amazon calls for more active and agile action in difficult times. “When something bad happens, you have three choices. You can let the crisis either become the determining factor in the fate of the company, or destroy it. Or you can try to make the most of a difficult situation and use your experience to your advantage,” the entrepreneur says. Bezos is confident that the crisis is the right time to strengthen the company's position in the market. For example, during a pandemic, when everyone was cutting costs and employees, Bezos, on the contrary, increased staff to meet demand.

In addition, the founder of Amazon considers it important during a crisis to explain to employees what is happening, what measures the company is taking to adapt to new conditions. Bezos also notes that subordinates should be thanked for the work done. “Let your employees know that you appreciate their efforts, that they continue to help your clients or customers. And let them know when customers say thank you. Employees need to feel appreciated, especially in difficult times,” says the entrepreneur.

**Jamie Dimon**

The CEO of the American investment bank JP Morgan Chase believes that a business has a chance to adequately survive the crisis if it has a margin of safety. Despite the fact that JP Morgan Chase faced serious problems during the global financial crisis of 2008, it survived it better than other Wall Street companies. For example, despite all the risks, JP Morgan Chase bought two banks in 2008 - Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. While competitors such as Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley suffered losses in the fourth quarter of 2008, JP Morgan managed to stay in positive territory and report a net income of $702 million. in the amount of $1.3 billion associated with the purchase of Washington Mutual.

If Dimon has any secret to success, it is this: unlike many leaders, he has the ability to constantly critically introspect both himself and the organization he leads. “I think healthy self-criticism is needed,” he says. This introspection forces Dimon to focus on the challenges, the risks, and what can be done better.

The head of JP Morgan teaches subordinates to admit their mistakes. As Dimon explains, “Look where you could be wrong. Admit your mistake. It's important for me. I want everyone to do this so that next time we really make a better decision.”

When Dimon hosts a management team meeting, he focuses not on wins and accomplishments, but on issues that need to be addressed. He also notices the good, but the emphasis is on challenges. At the same time, he does not shift the entire responsibility for solving problems to the heads of departments. He believes in dealing with challenges together and sharing the burden.

**Ruth Porat**

The Google CFO believes that a crisis is easier to prevent than to recover from it, so it is especially important to identify weaknesses and strengthen them in good times. This became especially clear during the 2008 global financial crisis (then Porat worked at Morgan Stanley, an investment bank that was hit hard by the recession, and was also part of a group of experts advising the US Treasury). One example is the lack of liquidity in many companies. “The financial crisis was linked to liquidity, which quickly dried up. That is, in order for the company to have a solid foundation, it was necessary to increase liquidity in advance,” Porat is sure. She makes several recommendations to help prepare for a crisis.

1.  **Collect data and analyze risks.** “I think the metaphor here is that you won't drive with dirt on the windshield. In the same way, it's not worth leading a business forward if you can't see anything. You need visibility and transparency,” says Porat.
2.  **Stock up on willpower and resources.** She considers this very important in a crisis, because very often by the time the manager decides to take action, the company no longer has the financial capacity to implement them. Speaking of funds, Porat warns that before spending them recklessly in good times, it is better to take care to create a cushion for a rainy day.
3.  **Put together a good team.** Porat believes that in times when you have to choose from the worst options, it is especially important what kind of employees work in the company. She considers the presence of a flair based on experience to be the main quality of subordinates. “I want people to have what I call battle scars. This is my first interview question. I need people who are able to recognize the first signs of problems, as they have already gone through both good and bad times before. So they know how to think three, four, five steps ahead,” says Porat.

**Reid Hoffman**

LinkedIn founder and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman argues that speed is important when scaling a business, and even more important in times of crisis. “I've been saying for a long time that in order to move fast, you need to develop your tolerance for small mistakes. When speed is a top priority, the job of a leader is to enable the team to make decisions quickly without looking back,” Hoffman said.

The investor also calls for increased communication in times of crisis. “Leaders often think they communicate a lot. Most are wrong. When you get tired of repeating the same thing two, three, four times, your team and clients are just beginning to understand your message. This is especially true in unstable times,” says Hoffman. He adds that it is also important not only to speak, but also to listen. “The best way to act quickly and correctly is to listen more. Seek advice. That being said, it's important to get information from people outside of your circle of trusted people. Even if it means getting out of your comfort zone. In fact, it is especially important here to get out of it, ”says the entrepreneur.

Hoffman also calls for a change in approach to work. “When everyone from startups to schools has to reinvent workflows, it's important to be flexible. But you need to understand that you can’t give up what was vital before,” the investor is sure.

**Brian Chesky**

The Airbnb founder agrees with Hoffman. “One of the first lessons I learned is that you need to act much faster in a crisis. People see the crisis as a decisive moment, so they are slow to make decisions, but instead, they need to, on the contrary, accelerate. You also need to increase communication. The faster things change, the more you need to communicate changes,” says the entrepreneur.

Another lesson that Chesky learned: in times of crisis, you can’t compromise. “Typically, there are two solutions, each with its pros and cons, and the compromise lies between them, and this is the worst thing a company can do. You have to go either to the right or to the left, there is no need to stop in the middle,” says Chesky.

The founder of Airbnb notes that in a crisis, the hardest thing to manage is not the company, but your thoughts. You can succumb to fear or despondency. Or you can say to yourself: “This is my defining moment, and it will leave an indelible mark.” “Then you can feed on fact-based optimism, and this will give hope for a way out of the situation. If you can exude that confidence, follow your principles and act quickly, then you can bring the company out of the crisis, like a captain takes a ship that is starting to sink, ”says Chesky.

**Alan Mulally**

Mulally managed to save such giants of the American market as Ford and Boeing from bankruptcy. He believes that in difficult times it is important to face reality, no matter how unpleasant it may be. In times of great stress, the worst thing a leader can do is ignore the true state of affairs or underestimate the problems facing the company. “It all starts with a meeting with reality. It's important to recognize her for who she is, not for who you want her to be," Mulally said.

Joining forces is the key to getting through difficult times, he says. Speaking about his experience at Boeing, Mulally recalls that working in a crisis begins with focusing the entire team on one goal. “We started with people. We have involved everyone, all stakeholders: airlines, passengers, employees, suppliers, investors, unions. Everyone participated,” Mulally said.

He believes that it is extremely important in a crisis to maintain the unity and focus of the team. “Working together always helps. Everyone should be on the same team,” Mulally said. At Ford, for example, Mulally introduced mandatory weekly meetings where executives discussed global trends and events, and then reported on the results and progress of work in subordinate departments and divisions.
