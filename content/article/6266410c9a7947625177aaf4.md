On the Internet, the “digital drug” – binaural beats – is gaining popularity. Listening to this music is believed to [help you get enough sleep](https://www.healthline.com/health/binaural-beats) , manage stress, and [improve your](https://csuglobal.edu/blog/increasing-cognitive-function-with-binaural-beats) cognitive abilities. Users even argue about whether it can cause a state of euphoria close to what a person who uses drugs feels. Songs with binaural beats are sometimes even referred to as certain illegal drugs, such as Molly Rave Riot (a reference to ecstasy) or Roofie Enhanced calm (a reference to the sleeping pill Rohypnol).

To understand whether binaural music can actually affect stress, sleep, and quality of life, we need to understand what it is, how the brain combines different frequencies, and why the whole world has suddenly started to go crazy for this technology.

It all started with brainwaves
------------------------------

Neurons in the human brain, interacting with each other, constantly generate electrical impulses - brain waves. They are measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG; a method in which electrodes are attached to the scalp to record signals). The state of a person, his thoughts and feelings depends on the predominance of certain frequencies at a particular moment in time.

Scientists [divide](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128044902000026) human brain waves into five main types. The higher the frequency, the stronger the state of excitation.

1.  **Alpha waves** are in the frequency band from 8 to 13 Hz. They correspond to a state of calm wakefulness, for example, immediately before falling asleep or immediately after waking up. These waves are blocked or weakened when a person concentrates on a task or thinks hard about something.
2.  **Beta waves** oscillate at a frequency of 15 to 35 Hz. This rhythm is inherent in the state of active wakefulness. If it increases, there may be a feeling of anxiety. When beta waves dominate, a person is focused and ready to make decisions and think analytically.
3.  **Gamma waves** are in the range from 35 to 50 Hz. They activate mental activity, increase concentration and general emotional perception of the world, and can cause a feeling of fear. Such a rhythm is observed when solving problems that require maximum concentration.
4.  **Delta waves** at a frequency of less than 4 Hz correspond to a trance state. This rhythm occurs during deep natural (or narcotic) sleep, as well as in a coma.
5.  **Theta waves** at frequencies between 5 and 7 Hz are associated with deep meditation, as well as REM sleep, which is characterized by increased brain activity and dreaming. This range is believed to promote relaxation, improve memory and learning ability, and relieve stress.

What are binaural beats
-----------------------

The name "binaural beats" itself is associated with a new musical genre, but in reality this term refers to the technique of combining two slightly different sound frequencies into one tone. To do this, different vibrations are fed into the headphones. With the simultaneous exposure to two frequencies (one in each ear), the brain actually perceives only the difference between them and, in a sense, "tunes" to a new wave. This is called the frequency following effect. For example, if the left ear receives a signal with a frequency of 300 Hz, and the right ear receives a signal with a frequency of 280 Hz, then the brain will process and assimilate the signal with a frequency of 10 Hz. For this to work, the tones [must be](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4428073/#B1) at frequencies below 1000 Hz, and the difference between them must not exceed 35 Hz.

The phenomenon of binaural beats [was discovered](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29187819/) by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove in 1841. But until the 1970s, little attention [was paid to](https://gizmodo.com/how-a-scientists-least-important-discovery-became-his-m-1742623371) it. In 1973, Gerard Oster [noticed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4727697/) that some people with neurological problems couldn't hear them. He suggested using this feature as a diagnostic method, which spurred interest in brain rhythms, primarily from adherents of alternative medicine.

It is believed that such an acoustic illusion [causes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4727697/) a number of changes in the state of the body. When a person's brain "synchronizes" with a certain wavelength, he [can](https://www.popsci.com/story/science/how-to-meditate-practice-mindfulness/) relax more deeply or, conversely, concentrate better.

What is binaural music capable of?
----------------------------------

Scientists are still only exploring the possibilities of binaural beats. A meta-analysis of 22 research papers statistically [confirmed](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-018-1066-8) the hypothesis that such compositions affect memory, attention, stress levels, and help relieve pain. This is because binaural beats stimulate the corresponding brain waves, and this [can affect](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2005.04287.x/full) the subsequent behavior and well-being of a person.

For example, listening to binaural beats at theta frequencies can induce a [meditative state](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28701912/) , relaxation and speed up falling asleep. At beta frequencies, binaural beats [help to](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28701912/) concentrate, improve memory and mood. In one [study,](https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_165050750385013&key=2c1037b147451d67d0869f8180772ebc&libId=l27tfxhl0103gjxa000DLblzbiscw&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Fstory%2Fhealth%2Fsounds-beats-focus-creativity-science%2F&ccpaConsent=1YN-&v=1&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontiersin.org%2Farticles%2F10.3389%2Ffnhum.2013.00786%2Ffull%2F&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&title=Do%20binaural%20beats%20benefit%20your%20brain%3F%20%7C%20Popular%20Science&txt=one%20study) some participants [performed better](https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_165050751881714&key=2c1037b147451d67d0869f8180772ebc&libId=l27tfxhl0103gjxa000DLblzbiscw&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Fstory%2Fhealth%2Fsounds-beats-focus-creativity-science%2F&ccpaConsent=1YN-&v=1&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Ftopics%2Fagricultural-and-biological-sciences%2Fbrain-waves%2F&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&title=Do%20binaural%20beats%20benefit%20your%20brain%3F%20%7C%20Popular%20Science&txt=%E2%80%9Calpha%E2%80%9D%20brain%20waves%20that%20are%20associated%20with%20a%20calm%20and%20relaxed%20state) on a creative task with alpha binaural beats. In addition, if a person listens to delta-frequency binaural compositions daily for two months, then his [level of anxiety will decrease](https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_165050751881714&key=2c1037b147451d67d0869f8180772ebc&libId=l27tfxhl0103gjxa000DLblzbiscw&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsci.com%2Fstory%2Fhealth%2Fsounds-beats-focus-creativity-science%2F&ccpaConsent=1YN-&v=1&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Ftopics%2Fagricultural-and-biological-sciences%2Fbrain-waves%2F&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&title=Do%20binaural%20beats%20benefit%20your%20brain%3F%20%7C%20Popular%20Science&txt=%E2%80%9Calpha%E2%80%9D%20brain%20waves%20that%20are%20associated%20with%20a%20calm%20and%20relaxed%20state) . This rhythm is also [useful](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2044.2005.04287.x) for anxiety before surgery. Moreover, the longer a person listens to such music, the stronger its impact.

Binaural music helps [reduce anxiety levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115248/) , which is why it is often [recommended](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/insomnia/treatment/what-do-when-you-cant-sleep) for sleep problems. So, an experiment was conducted with the participation of 15 football players who listened to rhythms in the range from 2 Hz to 8 Hz. Players [reported](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23862643/) improved sleep quality, less drowsiness and ease of waking up. Delta waves, in particular, [increase the](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Understanding-Sleep#2) duration of the deep sleep phase, which is important for the recovery of the body.

However, some researchers [have linked](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-are-binaural-beats) listening to binaural beats with increased feelings of depression. Some participants in the experiments noticed short and short bursts of frustration, anxiety, anger and confusion. Therefore, it is premature to talk about it as an effective way to manage the mental state.

It is also worth noting that the quality of the number of available studies on binaural music is questionable: many of them are conducted on a small sample, and the results are often collected using questionnaires - this is a rather subjective method. In addition, the long-term side effects of binaural music have not been studied.

Instructions for use
--------------------

To listen to binaural beats, you need a pair of headphones and an MP3 player or other music system. The sound must go to each ear. While researchers do not give specific recommendations for binaural therapy, it is worth focusing on the instructions offered by the providers of such tracks. If there is no desired effect, you can try other compositions or sets of sounds, other frequencies.

Do not listen to such music when performing tasks that require concentration and full attention, such as driving a car, as their effectiveness and possible contraindications have not yet been studied enough. It is better to start with shorter sessions and gradually increase the duration of exposure to binaural beats. Finally, don't play songs too loud: prolonged exposure to sound levels of 85 decibels or higher [can cause](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/noise-induced-hearing-loss) hearing loss.
